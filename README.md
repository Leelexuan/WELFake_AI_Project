# Abstract
The ease of access to the internet has made it possible for anyone to upload articles and information. It has become increasingly harder to fact check information and detect fake news. In this project, we hope to improve on the models and feature engineering methods used in the research paper produced by Reddy and Raj by training them on the WELFake dataset, which is a larger and more recently updated dataset. We would also like to explore the integrity of the dataset, and what makes fake news fake.
