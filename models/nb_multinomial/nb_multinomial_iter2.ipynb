         "\"Over 240,000 'unverified' ballots have already been sent out in Pennsylvania, a total mess. The Democrats are playing games again. Former President Donald Trump promoted a false theory that Democrats are using \"unverified\" ballots in Pennsylvania as part of an election plot. \"Over 240,000 'unverified' ballots have already been sent out in Pennsylvania, a total mess,\" Trump said Oct. 28 on his social media platform Truth Social. \"The Democrats are playing games again because they know they are in deep trouble after unleashing skyrocketing crime, record Inflation, a war against American Energy, etc. Luckily, some Great Patriots and members of the State House are watching very closely. Be careful! And VOTE!\" We saw similar posts on Instagram and Twitter, some falsely claiming that this was election stealing or fraud. Trump gives the impression that a huge number of residents who are ineligible to vote are casting ballots, and that has not been proved. A Republican lawmaker who wrote a letter in October to election officials raising concerns about unverified voters later told PolitiFact he found nothing \"nefarious\" about the \"not verified\" designation. State election officials said there have not been hundreds of thousands of \"unverified ballots.\" The claim makes an assumption based on how election officials code mail ballot applications. In Pennsylvania, voters can request an \"absentee ballot\" or a \"mail ballot.\" The absentee ballot is requested when voters have certain excuses, such as being out of town on Election Day. Any voter can request a mail ballot without citing a reason. How the state codes mail in ballot requests The claims about \"unverified\" voters circulated after a group of Republican state representatives sent an Oct. 25 letter to Leigh Chapman, the commonwealth’s acting secretary. The letter wrongly claimed that as of Oct. 21, state department data showed that counties had \"already mailed over 240,000 unverified ballots.\" The representatives asked Chapman to direct counties to not count ballots cast by voters whose identities were unverified. State officials responded that there are not more than 240,000 \"unverified ballots.\" The verification label relates to applications for mail ballots, not actual ballots cast and counted. In Pennsylvania, voters applying for mail or absentee ballots must provide their state driver’s license, state-issued photo ID or the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. Voters who have none can provide another form of ID, such as a photo ID from a college or a long-term care facility. The vast majority of voters provide proper ID when they apply for a mail ballot. However, if a voter lacks ID at the time of their request, local election officials are still required to provide a ballot. Such ballot applications are marked as \"NV,\" meaning \"not verified,\" as part of an internal workflow code that alerts the statewide voter registration system of applications that require further identification verification. Under Pennsylvania law, voters’ identifications are verified the first time they vote in person or each time they request a mail or absentee ballot, Chapman said in an Oct. 28 letter to the Republican legislators. County election officials are responsible for verifying voters’ identifications, primarily through an automated process. Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 25, 2022 in an Instagram post The documentary “2,000 Mules proves” Democrats “cheated on the 2020 elections.” By Jon Greenberg • October 28, 2022 If an applicant’s identification was not provided or could not be verified, the local election officials send a notice to the elector, along with the ballot, saying identification is required for the ballot to be counted. A city of Philadelphia spokesperson told us that the application type assigned to the applicant, either V (verified) or NV, will never change during an election. After a voter’s ID is verified, the application type remains the same, but the application’s status will be updated. Ballot applications can be marked \"NV\" for a variety of reasons. For example, applications would get this mark if they are from voters on the permanent mail-in or absentee list who requested mail ballots for both the primary and general elections and who need to have their IDs reverified for the general election. Though the number continues to shift, Chapman told reporters that as of noon Nov. 1, about 7,400 applications still needed ID verification. Pennsylvania law gives voters six days after Election Day — this year, until Nov. 14 — to provide identification. If identification cannot be verified by the sixth day, the ballot is not counted. Washington County Elections Director Melanie Ostrander told the Observer-Reporter that unverified voters are likely people who requested ballots using a nickname or who forgot to add a suffix, such as junior or senior, in their applications. Frank Ryan, R-Lebanon, one of the state legislators who sent the letter to election officials, told PolitiFact that the \"NV\" coding does not represent \"any nefarious behavior,\" but shows that \"the system is poorly designed.\" Trump’s statement suggests that the \"unverified\" situation is something Democrats orchestrated. But the \"NV\" coding pertains to ballots sent by election officials across the state, which includes red, blue and battleground areas. The October letter from Republican lawmakers doesn’t single out \"Democrats,\" although Chapman is a Democrat appointed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. We sent an email to spokespersons for Trump and received no response. Our ruling Trump said \"over 240,000 'unverified' ballots have already been sent out in Pennsylvania, a total mess. The Democrats are playing games again.\" Trump’s statement suggests wrongdoing on behalf of Democrats, but we found no evidence of any attempts to manipulate the election. One of the Republican legislators who wrote a letter to the state about those ballots told PolitiFact he saw no nefarious behavior. A computer system flags a mail ballot application as \"NV,\" or not verified, if further steps are required to verify a voter’s identification. But that doesn’t mean that 240,000 ballots were sent to unverified or ineligible voters. We rate this claim False.

         "Says \"Ron Johnson is making excuses for rioters who tried to overthrow our government, even calling them ‘peaceful protests.’ Public testimony about what happened at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, might be over for the year, but the matter is far from closed, as a special House select committee has subpoenaed former President Donald Trump. In the meantime, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who is locked in a tough re-election battle, is being targeted for statements he has made about those who showed up in Washington that day. An ad launched Oct. 19 and posted on YouTube by the Senate Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats to the Senate, made this claim: \"Ron Johnson is making excuses for rioters who tried to overthrow our government, even calling them ‘peaceful protests.’\" According to NBC News, End Citizens United, another PAC, also helped pay for the ad. Is the ad right? Let’s take a look. What has Johnson said? When asked to provide backup for the ad’s claim, Tina Olechowski, communications director for End Citizens United, directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to several news articles. One of the cited articles, a Feb. 23, 2021, piece from the New York Daily News, included this: \"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) claimed Tuesday (Feb. 23, 2021) that leftists posing as Trump supporters played a role in storming the Capitol. The pro-Trump lawmaker, who has said the attack ‘didn’t seem like an insurrection,’ read from an uncorroborated account of the riot that included claims that ‘fake Trump supporters’ and provocateurs help stir the violence.\" Another article, posted March 13, 2021, by Politico, noted a radio interview by Johnson on the conservative Joe Pags Show. Here is part of what Johnson said, based on a clip posted on YouTube that day by NBC’s \"Today Show\": \"‘Even though those thousands of people that were marching to the Capitol were trying to pressure people like me to vote the way they wanted me to vote, I knew those were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law, and so I wasn’t concerned,\" Johnson told Pags. \"Now, had the tables been turned — Joe, this could get me in trouble — had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned.\" Veronica Yae-in Yoo, Senate Majority PAC communications director, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, directed us to other broadcast accounts, including a May 21, 2021, CNN report headlined, \"Sen. Ron Johnson calls Capitol insurrection a ‘peaceful protest’ \" Alexa Henning, a spokesperson for Johnson, said that by \"peaceful protests,\" Johnson was referring to, for instance, \"an example on MSNBC, a clip of protesters walking within rope lines in statuary hall.\" Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 But that single clip flies in the face of dozens upon dozens upon dozens of other videos, stories, eyewitness accounts and evidence gathered by the House committee into what was actually happening. When Johnson has claimed — repeatedly — that the day’s events were not an armed insurrection, we have rated that claim Pants on Fire. One 11-minute video compilation released by the House committee is composed of security footage from inside and outside the Capitol building, police bodycam video and rooftop footage. It includes plenty of scenes of violence and chaos. For instance, protesters erected a noose and chanted, \"Hang Mike Pence.\" There were chants of \"Nancy, Nancy,\" as protesters sought out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Objects were used to break windows, allowing protesters to climb inside the building. Overwhelmed police could be heard on radios shouting, \"We can’t hold the line!\" and \"Officer down.\" Another is heard shouting, \"Fall back! Fall back!\" as his position is overrun. As we have noted in a past item: Criminal charges brought against more than 900 protesters by the U.S. Justice Department have made clear that the events of that day were part of a coordinated effort to prevent the lawful transfer of power to newly elected President Joe Biden. The House committee hearings included video footage and photos of the attack, showing participants erecting gallows, deploying pepper spray, hurling a fire extinguisher, using baseball bats to smash windows and throwing flags like spears at police officers. The government estimated damage to the U.S. Capitol building and grounds at $1.5 million. So, Johnson has had a clear history of minimizing what took place, misdirection on who is to blame for it, and generally downplaying reports that have shown the true nature of the insurrection that happened that day. That said, the ad ignores the distinction Henning, the Johnson spokesperson, says the senator has tried to make. She argues that Johnson has condemned those who rioted, even as he has used much more favorable terms to describe others there that day. She cited a May 19, 2021, Johnson appearance on Fox News’ \"Ingraham Angle,\" and posted online by Rumble, in which the senator said, \"I condemned the breach. I condemned the violence. But to say there were thousands of armed insurrectionists, breaching the capitol, intent on overthrowing the government is simply a false narrative. … By and large it was all peaceful protests, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol.\" Henning claimed as many as 120,000 showed up at the mall to protest and about 2,000 entered the Capitol. News reports about the day said it was difficult to accurately estimate the crowd size because there were no aerial images. But then-U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said law enforcement estimated the crowd size ahead of the protest up to 80,000. \"The senator is attempting to draw contrast to those vastly different figures,\" Henning said. \"Given those numbers, the majority was peaceful … He has always said those who broke the law that day, should be prosecuted.\" Our ruling An ad from Senate Majority PAC and End Citizens United claimed \"Ron Johnson is making excuses for rioters who tried to overthrow our government, even calling them ‘peaceful protests.’\" Johnson has clearly minimized and downplayed what happened that day, and sought to direct blame elsewhere. So, there is much to what the ad claims. That said, it blows past statements where Johnson has been more explicit in condemning those who broke the law. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

         "“We have seen over the last 10 years ... under Republican governors a rise in the murder rate in Arizona of 20%. In the Sept. 28 attorney general debate hosted by Arizona PBS, Democrat Kris Mayes said, \"We have seen over the last 10 years, under Republican agencies and Republican governors, a rise in the murder rate in Arizona of 20%.\" The Republican Party has controlled the governorship and both houses of the state Legislature for the last decade. The number of homicides rose during that time, but so did the state’s population. That undercuts Mayes’ statement. Distinguishing between the number of murders and the murder rate We reached out to Maye’s press office and it pointed to a fact sheet from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a Democratic advocacy group. The document used data collected by the Arizona Department of Public Safety showing the state’s raw number of homicides per year from 2010 to 2020, the most recent year of data collection. The number of murders increased by 20.62% from 2010 to 2020, state data shows. In the debate, Mayes referred to the murder rate, which is different from the number of murders. The rate is the frequency of murders per 100,000 people. Edward Maguire, criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University, said a simple count of homicides is misleading. \"Because during that same period, the population of the state grew,\" said Maguire. \"The appropriate way to do this analysis of change is to use homicide rates.\" Including 2020, the murder rate in the state increased by about 4.14% over the last decade. The FBI also tracks homicides and although its yearly numbers differ from the state’s, the trends and patterns in homicides are the same. The COVID year outlier The 4.14% increase in murder rates between 2010 and 2020 does not tell the whole story. Featured Fact-check Mark Finchem stated on October 9, 2022 in a rally The Electronic Registration Information Center is “a system that’s funded by George Soros.” By Amy Sherman • October 17, 2022 As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, homicides in Arizona, and the United States, skyrocketed in 2020. Criminologists advise caution when including 2020 in an analysis of murder rates. \"In 2020, violence was disrupted by a massive environmental change that impacted culture, routine activities, levels of anxiety, employment, etc,\" said Charles Katz, a criminology professor and director of the Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety at Arizona State University. The exact reasons for the increase in murders in 2020 are still being studied, Katz said. Excluding 2020 from the decadelong analysis makes a difference. From 2010 to 2019, homicide rates in Arizona decreased by about 20.58%. The data also shows that homicide rates fluctuated throughout the decade. Rates fell slightly from 2012 to 2015, then increased from 2016 to 2017, and fell from 2017 to 2019. The murder rate then crept upward in 2019. \"These kinds of fluctuations are typically a consequence of broader environmental and macro level changes,\" said Katz. \"These changes are modest and it would be tough to assess the causes.\" Our ruling Mayes said, \"We have seen over the last 10 years under Republican agencies and Republican governors a rise in the murder rate in Arizona of 20%.\" Mayes’ number is incorrect. The number of murders in the state increased by 20% from 2010 to 2020, but the murder rate rose by 4%. That span includes the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted many norms, including homicide patterns. Excluding that year, the murder rate fell by about 20% We rate this claim Mostly False.",

         "“I don’t get involved in the hiring and firing of police chiefs. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney is downplaying the role he may have played in the recent resignation of city police Chief Gerald Smith and his hiring in 2020. \"I don’t get involved in the hiring and firing of police chiefs,\" Stoney said during a news conference on Oct 26, one day after Smith stepped down. We fact-checked Stoney’s claim and found it to be at polar odds with statements he made in 2020 taking credit for hiring Smith and the hiring and firing of his predecessor. Smith had been under fire for low morale in the department, rising attrition of officers and a \"no confidence\" vote in December 2021 from the city’s police union. Smith capped his downfall by providing false information to justify his unsubstantiated claim that Richmond police foiled a mass shooting allegedly planned for July 4 at Dogwood Dell. Before the story unraveled, Stoney ballyhooed the supposed police victory at a July 6 news conference with Smith, saying, \"it saved lives.\" The story made national headlines. Smith resigned during a meeting with Lincoln Saunders, Stoney’s hand-picked chief administrative officer. Stoney was asked by reporters the next day if he had requested the resignation and repeatedly answered that he did not attend the meeting. Asked why he would stay out of such a significant meeting, Stoney replied, \"I don’t get involved in the hiring and firing of police chiefs.\" History Let’s flash back to June 2019 when another Smith — William Smith — was hired as Richmond’s police chief. Stoney announced the hiring at a press conference. A news release issued by his office put the selection firmly in his hand with the headline \"Mayor appoints Interim Chief William Smith to be next chief of Police Department.\" The news release quoted Stoney saying, \"The chief of police is one of the most important jobs in any city government, requiring skills that go well beyond policing itself.\" It described \"an extensive national search\" to find a new chief that landed on William Smith, a 24-year veteran of the Richmond Police Department. William Smith, at the news conference, thanked Stoney and his then chief administrative officer, Selena Cuffee-Glenn, \"for their continued faith in me.\" A year later, William Smith was in deep trouble over police conduct during protests in Richmond following the Minnesota murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. In tense standoffs, Richmond police dispersed protestors with rubber bullets and tear gas. On one occasion, police fired tear gas without warning into a peaceful crowd at the Robert E. Lee statue. Stoney apologized for the widely-criticized action. Featured Fact-check Yesli Vega stated on October 20, 2022 in an interview. They were “never my comments” that a woman can’t get pregnant from rape. By Warren Fiske • November 4, 2022 Two weeks later, Stoney announced that he had requested and received William Smith’s resignation. \"I have high expectations for the Richmond Police Department, our law enforcement,\" Stoney said. \"At a very minimum, I expect them to be willing to come around the table with the community to reform and reimagine public safety. So, it boils down to whether the leadership of RPD embraces the change or stands in the way.\" Stoney promised a national search for a new chief who would bring change to the department and improve community relations. Ten days later, Stoney announced he hired Gerald Smith — the deputy police chief in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North Carolina — to head Richmond’s force. \"I spoke to a number of candidates,\" Stoney said at a June 26, 2020, news conference. \"Chief Gerald Smith rose to the top. I think he’s the sort of leadership we need in this time in the city of Richmond.\" Stoney’s explanation We asked Stoney’s press office to explain the mayor’s claim that he doesn’t get involved in the hiring and firing of police chiefs. We received a written statement that Saunders, the chief administrative officer, issued Oct. 27, the day after Stoney’s news conference. Saunders said he called Stoney to tell him about Smith’s resignation and the outgoing chief’s request to be placed on administrative leave through the end of the year. Saunders said Stoney agreed with his recommendation to appoint Rick Edwards, a 20-year veteran of the Richmond police department, interim chief. \"Handling personnel matters is the responsibility of the [chief administrative officer],\" Saunders wrote. \"However, when it involves members of senior city leadership, especially members of the team that will serve in the mayor’s cabinet, I always discuss my recommendations, and the reasons behind them, with the mayor, as the chief executive. \"If the mayor concurs with my recommendation I move forward, if he does not, I come back to him with additional recommendations for consideration,\" Saunders added. Saunders included in his statement a portion of the city’s charter that lays out the chief administrative officer’s power. Our ruling Stoney said, \"I don’t get involved in the hiring and firing of police chiefs.\" The mayor said he didn’t have a role in the recent resignation of police Chief Gerald Smith, and we can’t put the ax in his hand. Gerald Smith’s resignation was received by Stoney’s chief administrative officer. But Stoney took credit for Gerald Smith’s hiring in June 2020. And he took credit for the hiring and firing of Smith’s predecessor — William Smith. Stoney said so at press conferences announcing these events and in news releases issued by his office. Based on the mayor’s own words, we rate his statement False.",

         "\"Don Bolduc wants to cut trillions from Medicare and end Social Security. Aiming to retain her congressional seat and keep Democrats in control of the Senate, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., attacked her Republican opponent over two venerable safety net programs. \"Don Bolduc wants to cut trillions from Medicare and end Social Security. That’s not what New Hampshire needs,\" reads the text of a Hassan ad on Facebook and Instagram. Hassan made a similar attack against Bolduc, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general, in other ads that include video clips of him saying \"$1.2 trillion from Medicare, $2 trillion from Social Security.\" Hassan’s attack rests on Bolduc’s comments since 2020 about both programs. But Bolduc has retreated from some of his farthest-reaching proposals. Responding to Hassan’s claim, his campaign pointed PolitiFact only to statements Bolduc has made pledging to keep Social Security strong. In one TV ad released Oct. 28, Bolduc gives qualified support to the programs, saying he won’t cut Social Security and Medicare \"for older Americans.\" The Nov. 8 contest could help determine which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Bolduc on Oct. 31. \"Cut trillions from Medicare\" To back this part of its claim, Hassan’s campaign cited comments Bolduc made in 2020 about his plan to reduce federal spending over a decade. Bolduc, who sought the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire in 2020, told the Hillsborough County (N.H.) Republican Committee in May 2020 that one of his priorities would be reducing federal spending. Bolduc said he had a plan to reduce spending by $10.8 trillion over the following 10 years, including \"$1.2 trillion from Medicare, $2 trillion from Social Security\" and $4 trillion from Medicaid. He did not detail how he would make those cuts. Bolduc continued to call for big Medicare changes during his 2022 campaign. At an August town hall, Bolduc responded to a nurse’s Medicare and Medicaid question by saying, \"The privatization is hugely important. Getting government out of it, getting government money with strings attached out of it.\" Politico obtained an audio recording of the town hall for its September report about Bolduc’s Medicare comments. But Bolduc’s campaign told Politico that Bolduc now opposes privatizing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Bolduc addressed his August comments in two subsequent interviews. Bolduc told WMUR-TV that he \"never said privatize Medicare,\" even though Bolduc did say that. \"I said we need to look at solutions that make Medicare more patient-responsive.\" In a radio interview, Bolduc was more vague, saying he would \"invest in a solid Medicare program\" that puts people, not the government, \"in charge of their health care.\" \"End Social Security\" Bolduc talked about transitioning out of Social Security in the same May 2020 virtual meeting with local Republicans. Featured Fact-check Rick Scott stated on October 30, 2022 in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" “All Democrats in the Senate and House voted to cut $280 billion out of Medicare just two months ago.” By Louis Jacobson • October 31, 2022 Bolduc proposed phasing in a new system for young people. \"We could build a flexible universal savings program for the younger generation that they take with them everywhere they go that has special protections, and that becomes theirs. And over time, we no longer have Social Security, we just have a different system that's able to take the place of Social Security over time.\" Some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system in which workers invest at least some of their money to provide for retirement. Currently, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by current workers. Bolduc made similar comments to other local GOP committees in 2020. He said at one forum, \"Our younger people need a completely different program, like universal savings accounts.\" At another event, he said, \"For the younger generation, we have to come up with a universal savings account that allows them to save in a different way than we saved,\" and allowing some middle-aged people to opt out of Social Security. According to audio and video clips cited by Hassan’s campaign, a man at one event asked how Bolduc would ensure that the man would receive his full Social Security benefits. Bolduc said \"we need to invest in Social Security\" for current recipients and those soon to be receiving Social Security, but for people who are now roughly 45 or 50 years or old or younger, \"we’re going to develop a new program for you ... because Social Security right now is not going to work for us.\" Bolduc also spoke about privatizing Social Security on Oct. 10, 2022, in an audio recording obtained by the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper. \"We've got a lot of work to do to protect it, get the money back into it and making sure nobody messes with it,\" Bolduc said of Social Security. Bolduc was then asked, \"Do you think you could work with some senators to find a way to start the private investment accounts?\" Bolduc answered, \"That's right, yeah.\" The Bolduc campaign denied to the newspaper that Bolduc had endorsed privatizing Social Security, calling it a \"false attack\" by Hassan. In the September radio interview, Bolduc said, \"I’m not promoting privatization. What I want is responsibility in the government program that exists now, look at something different for our younger generation, work with them to figure out what it is.\" Bolduc told WMUR in September about his May 2020 comments: \"We have to look at what is going to be better for the younger generation. How do they want to invest their money?\" Our ruling Hassan said Bolduc \"wants to cut trillions from Medicare and end Social Security.\" In 2020, Bolduc advocated for cutting $1.2 trillion for Medicare and in August 2022 he called for \"getting government out\" of Medicare. In 2020 and again in October 2022, Bolduc advocated that future retirees transition from Social Security to private savings accounts. In September, Bolduc’s campaign told Politico that he no longer supports privatizing either program. But his October comments reiterated support for eventually changing Social Security to private investments accounts. Hassan’s ad exaggerates the trillions Bolduc once said he would take out of Medicare (it’s over $1 trillion), but Bolduc has endorsed gradually ending Social Security by moving future retirees into private investment accounts. With that clarification, we rate Hassan’s statement Mostly True. RELATED: Fact-checking ads in the 2022 election campaigns RELATED: Democrats attack Republican Social Security plans. What’s in them?

         "Video shows Marjorie Taylor Greene planted pipe bombs at Republican and Democratic party headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021 Federal investigators are using photos and video to deconstruct exactly what took place during the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. An Instagram post is using the same tactic — to try to suggest that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is the suspect who planted pipe bombs at the Democratic and Republican National Convention offices the night before. The Oct. 27 Instagram video shows Greene walking down a hallway, her left arm swinging as she holds a briefcase in her right, side by side with footage of the unnamed suspect carrying what investigators believe to be a bag of pipe bombs. The suspect’s left arm swings as the person’s right arm carries what looks like a bag of some kind. \"Is Marjorie Taylor Greene the Capitol riot pipe bomber?\" words across the top of the video read. \"Look at that arm swing,\" the caption accompanying it said. \"Anything is possible at this point.\" This was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook.) The pipe bomb suspect has yet to be identified, and the FBI has not released any information to suggest that Greene is connected. The FBI has named no suspects, but it has released a great deal of evidence in the case. This includes security footage and a virtual map that highlights the path investigators believe the suspect took while placing the two bombs on Tuesday, Jan. 5, between approximately 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. — the night before the U.S. Capitol riots. The bombs were discovered and disarmed by authorities on Jan. 6, 2021. Kamala Harris, then-vice president-elect, was in the DNC office when the bomb was discovered outside, according to reporting by Politico. We reached out to the FBI to comment on the claim. They did not provide specifics on their investigation, but a spokesperson said the agency did not have any new information that they could release publicly. Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 \"The FBI’s investigation into who placed pipe bombs near the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees on January 5, 2021, is active and ongoing,\" they said, along with a request for the public to view photos of the suspect on their website and provide any tips they may have. On Jan. 5, 2021, it appears Greene was in Washington, D.C., and active on social media posts and in interviews, speaking out against the presidential election results. A video posted to Twitter showed her standing in front of the U.S. Capitol as she told followers to object to the vote and get ready to \"fight for America tomorrow.\" In a Newsmax interview that day, Greene said the plan to object to the electoral results on Jan. 6 was \"our 1776 moment.\" Greene was the target of a separate legal effort by the advocacy group Free Speech for People, which alleged she violated the third clause of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars anyone who has \"previously taken an oath as a member of Congress\" from having \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or (given) aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" During an April court hearing in that matter, Greene denied that she had involvement with any planning of the violent insurrection before it took place. An administrative law judge in Georgia sided with Greene in the case, writing in May that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Greene \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or (gave) aid or comfort to the enemies thereof under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\" This isn’t the first time some on social media have hypothesized that Greene was involved. Last year, we rated Pants on Fire! a claim that an image showed Greene tweeted something suggesting she was being investigated for the matter. The tweet was fabricated. Finding no evidence to substantiate the suggestion that Greene is the DNC and RNC pipe bomb suspect, we rate this claim False. PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this pos",

         "\"Crime is up under Governor DeSantis. Crime was down when I was your governor. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist tried to raise doubts about Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' \"law and order\" style of leadership in their only debate before the Nov. 8 election. Crist, who served as governor from 2007 to 2010, contrasted crime rates from his time in office with those under DeSantis. \"Crime is up under Governor DeSantis,\" Crist said Oct. 24. \"Crime was down when I was your governor because we enforced the laws and made sure Floridians were safe.\" PolitiFact decided to fact-check Crist's crime comparison. Crist didn't specify whether he was referring to violent or nonviolent crime during the debate. One issue surfaced right away: The data for half of DeSantis' term is not ready. Incomplete data for most of DeSantis' term State crime statistics come from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which collects crime data from local law enforcement agencies for an annual report presented to the Legislature and the FBI for the national Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The data has several limitations. Its quality depends on the accuracy of the information supplied to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement by local police agencies. But they have made reporting errors before. With that in mind, overall crime fell by about 12% from 2007 to 2010 — Crist's first and last full year as governor. DeSantis took office in 2019. From 2019 to 2020, reported crimes fell from 541,328 to 464,805 — a 14% decrease. That figure includes violent offenses, including murder and rape, and property offenses, such as robbery and motor vehicle theft. Put another way, the crime rate dropped from about 2,552 reported crimes per 100,000 residents to 2,158 per 100,000 residents. But there are caveats: the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has not published data for more recent years of DeSantis' term. Crime totals for 2021 won't be released until Nov. 30; numbers for 2022 won't be available until 2023. The state did not allow PolitiFact to preview the 2021 report ahead of its release.

By Michael Majchrowicz • October 17, 2022 Although crimes dropped a significant amount in 2020, researchers are still assessing how the pandemic and its accompanying lockdown orders affected crime. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); When we asked Crist's campaign about his claim, a spokesperson said Crist was referring to trends in violent crime. According to the department, violent crime decreased from 128,144 to 98,564 over Crist's four years — a 23.1% drop. Violent crime rose from 81,091 in 2019 to 83,290 in 2020 — a 2.7% increase after DeSantis' first year. The rate of violent crime per 100,000 residents rose 0.9%. Again, without figures for the remainder of DeSantis' term, it's not a full comparison. Violent crimes account for a small number of all criminal offenses in Florida, and slight changes can skew the trend. \"Violent crimes, especially homicides, are still relatively rare,\" said Lyndsay Boggess, professor at the University of South Florida's Department of Criminology. \"Even minor changes in the number of murders can appear like dramatic increases in the rate.\" Boggess said changes in reported crimes from one year to the next can reflect statistical anomalies or external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. She also cautioned against attributing too much influence to politicians over crime trends. \"Enforcement decisions are made at the local level, so police chiefs and sheriffs probably have more of an impact on crime,\" Boggess said. \"However, the Legislature and governors can fund programs and appoint judges.\" Our ruling Crist said, \"Crime is up under Governor DeSantis. Crime was down when I was your governor.\" This is a misleading claim. Data from DeSantis' third and fourth years in office is not yet available, so the comparison with Crist’s full term is incomplete. Nevertheless, overall crime — including robbery and motor vehicle theft, among other offenses — dropped more than 13% in DeSantis' first year in office. Violent crimes alone increased by 2% in 2020, the most recent data available. The effects of the pandemic on crime are still being studied. Even though crime fell over Crist’s time in office, every one of his years as governor had a higher volume of crime and a higher crime rate than what is on record so far for DeSantis.

         "The price of gas is “down from over $5 when I took office. High gasoline prices have been a political challenge for President Joe Biden and Democrats in this midterm election year. During an Oct. 27 visit to Syracuse, New York, Biden flubbed a statistic on gas prices, prompting a swarm of criticism among political commentators and on social media. \"Today, the most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office,\" Biden said in remarks about microchip manufacturing in Syracuse. Biden was in the ballpark about the most common gas price when he was making his remarks. But the national average gas price hit $5 under Biden this past summer, and prices were not at that level when Biden was inaugurated in January 2021. Gas prices rose during Biden’s presidency, mainly because of increased demand as the economy recovered from disruptions wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine also caused havoc in the oil markets. Russia is a major world oil producer and many Western nations tried to wean themselves from Russian oil in protest of the war. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the monthly peak for gasoline prices in the U.S. came in June. That’s when the average nationwide price hit $5.03, crossing the $5 level for the first time in history. In the second week of that month, the weekly price peaked at $5.11. (These prices are not adjusted for inflation.) Since then, prices have fallen, something Biden has been eager to tout. The most recent weekly price for October is $3.89, representing a decline of about $1.22, or 23%, in about four months. Featured Fact-check Viral image stated on October 18, 2022 in an Instagram post Kamala Harris said, “We have to acknowledge gas is high which is the opposite of low.” By Ciara O'Rourke • October 18, 2022 Even after this decline, gas prices remain well above where they were when Biden took office. The week he was inaugurated, the average price stood at $2.46, because of the impact the pandemic was having on the economy at a time when vaccines were just being rolled out. So gas is about 58% more expensive now than it was in January 2021, even after the past four months of declining prices. The White House pointed PolitiFact to other recent examples of Biden getting the rise and fall of gas prices right. On Oct. 26, for instance, Biden said during a virtual fundraiser that gas is \"going to be down … $1.35 since this summer.\" And at another point in the same Syracuse speech, he said, \"We’re down $1.25 since the peak this summer.\" Our ruling Biden said the price of gas is \"down from over $5 when I took office.\" The national average gasoline price did exceed $5, but that peak came this past June, and prices were not at that level when Biden was inaugurated in January 2021. When he was inaugurated, the price was about $2.46. We rate the statement False. RELATED: Gasoline prices: Where they stand now, and w",

         "A Phoenix TV station aired the election results more than a week early Social media users are seizing on a Phoenix TV station’s accidental broadcast of mock election results to fuel suspicions about election interference. With Arizona’s gubernatorial election more than a week away, KSAZ-TV, Channel 10, a Fox affiliate in Phoenix, aired a graphic that showed a photo of Democratic candidate and Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs next to the figure 53% and a checkmark, and a photo of Republican candidate Kari Lake next to the figure 47%. Some Lake supporters were upset by the graphic and suggested it was evidence of a plot to illegally steal the election from her. \"HOLY CRAP,\" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk tweeted. \"Fox10 — Kari Lake’s former station — just displayed a graphic showing Katie Hobbs won the Arizona governor’s race 12 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\" Lake was a longtime news anchor at the station before running for office. One Instagram account, sharing a screenshot of the tweet, suggested this was evidence of election interference. Another said: \"They will try everything to steal it.\" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

On Oct. 27, the day the graphic aired, the station tweeted about what happened. RELATED VIDEO \"At 5:50p during the Fox 10 newscast today a small graphic appeared on the lower left side of the screen showing test results for the upcoming election. These were generated by the Associated Press which distributes results to clients,\" the station said. \"This graphic was never meant to go on air — the numbers were only part of a test. The station has taken steps to make sure this cannot happen again.\" For more than a century, The Associated Press has counted the votes in elections and declared winners in races. Those results are provided to local news outlets. Leading up to an election, The Associated Press provides local news outlets with randomly generated sample numbers that it uses in system tests. In summer 2022, after two Michigan TV stations accidentally published the mock election results a week before the state’s primary, the AP issued a statement saying the mock results are clearly labeled and not for publication. \"Before any election, AP sends clearly labeled test data to its customers as part of its routine testing,\" the July 22 statement said. The test data is randomly generated and is not based on any predictive analysis or polling. It is not for publication. The test data is in no way representative of actual votes.\" During the KSAZ broadcast, when the graphic appeared on screen, the anchor was talking about expensive rental prices in some Arizona cities, not the election. Just a day earlier, the station had reported on poll results that showed Lake leading the governor’s race. It aired a graphic that showed Lake with 54% of the vote, according to the poll. Hobbs, meanwhile, had 43%. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

West Virginia’s Democratic Party recently took Republicans to task for opposing President Joe Biden’s efforts to enact partial forgiveness for student debts. In a tweeted statement, state Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin argued that Republicans don’t understand the financial pressures that recent college graduates do, especially Miller, given her personal wealth. Miller, Pushkin said, \"is a multi-millionaire worth over $16 million.\" Is this description of her personal finances accurate? Well, it’s complicated. (Neither Pushkin nor Miller’s office responded to inquiries for this article.) Data from OpenSecrets.org, a nonprofit research organization tracking money in U.S. politics, shows Miller’s net worth was $16,037,033 in 2018. This number stems from personal financial disclosure forms all members of Congress file that cover their holdings and those of their spouses. These forms require the disclosure of a variety of assets and liabilities, with certain categories of assets and liabilities listed within broad dollar ranges. Some of Miller’s wealth stems from the holdings of her husband, Matt Miller, who owns five Dutch Miller auto dealerships and has a stake in MFM Realty, a real estate company, the Dominion Post reported. The couple’s holdings also include a mixture of stocks.

This means that the actual dollar value of Miller’s holdings could be higher than $16 million, or it could be lower. It’s impossible to know, given how the forms are designed. \"Assets are reported in very broad ranges, so it’s always more accurate to portray these rough estimates as ranges,\" Alex Baumgart, an OpenSecrets researcher, told PolitiFact West Virginia. Meanwhile, these numbers are 4 years old. On the form Miller filed this year, which covers 2021, the midpoint estimate of her net worth was about $15.8 million, which is close to $16 million. Given this year’s overall decline in stock values, it’s possible that Miller’s net worth has declined since 2021. But we won’t know for sure until next year, when she files her form covering 2022. Our ruling The West Virginia Democratic Party said, \"Carol Miller is a multi-millionaire worth over $16 million.\" Financial disclosure forms for 2018 and 2021 show that, using the standard method of estimation, Miller’s net worth is about $16 million.

         "Adam Laxalt is “anti-DACA” and “fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general. In Nevada’s Senate race, Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and her Republican opponent Adam Laxalt have attacked each other’s records on crime and the opioid crisis. Both served as the state’s attorney general. Cortez Masto is also spotlighting Laxalt’s stance on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that prevents the deportation of immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children. \"I have an opponent right now who isn't just anti-DACA. He actually fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general,\" Cortez Masto tweeted Oct. 13. \"He used his power to attack people who were brought to this country as children.\" But I have an opponent right now who isn't just anti-DACA. He actually fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general.He used his power to attack people who were brought to this country as children.https://t.co/StSSP2v5aa— Catherine Cortez Masto (@CortezMasto) October 13, 2022 The tweet links to an Axios article that said Laxalt spent $13,000 in radio ads \"touting his opposition to protections for immigrants who were brought to the country as children.\" As he sought the Republican nomination, Laxalt ran TV and radio ads promoting his success in a lawsuit against the Obama administration. He argued DACA amounted to granting \"amnesty for illegal immigrants.\" He joined a lawsuit against an expansion of DACA, but did not join a lawsuit against the program’s original version because it already had beneficiaries. DACA overview The Department of Homeland Security secretary created DACA via a 2012 memorandum. DACA does not grant legal immigration status to its beneficiaries, but it protects them from deportation and allows them to apply for work permits and a Social Security number. These protections and benefits are provided in two-year renewable intervals. To qualify for DACA, people must meet specific requirements related to their age and the time frame in which they arrived in the United States. They are ineligible if they have been convicted of a felony, certain misdemeanors, or if they pose a threat to national security or public safety. In November 2014, DHS issued a memo expanding DACA eligibility (regarding age and arrival date). It also created a similar program to benefit parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Laxalt’s legal challenges against DACA As Nevada’s attorney general in January 2015, Laxalt joined 24 other states in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama’s implementation of the expanded version of DACA, introduced in 2014, and the new program for parents. The lawsuit argued that the 2014 memo violated the Administrative Procedure Act — a law that describes how federal agencies can make and enforce regulations. Featured Fact-check Adam Laxalt stated on November 20, 2022 in an ad “Biden and Democrats have dismantled border security.” By Maria Ramirez Uribe • November 3, 2022 \"Our immigration system is broken and clearly needs to be fixed. But just as clearly, the solution is not for the president to act unilaterally disregarding the U.S. Constitution and laws,\" Laxalt said in a 2015 statement. Cortez Masto’s team pointed PolitiFact to Laxalt’s decision to join the lawsuit as evidence for her claim that he fought against protections for DACA recipients. The attorneys general’s case rose to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016, which left in place a lower court’s decision blocking DACA’s expansion and the new program for parents of U.S. citizens and green card holders. In 2017, when the Trump administration tried to rescind the original version of DACA, 15 attorneys general sued the government aiming to keep DACA protections in place. Laxalt did not join that lawsuit. The Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration in a 5-4 decision. In 2018, nine states sued the Trump administration, claiming the original DACA program was created illegally. Laxalt did not join this lawsuit. He drew a distinction between suing to end a program that already has enrollees (original DACA) and suing to end an expansion of that program and a program that had no beneficiaries. This year, a federal appeals court ruled DACA illegal. However, it remains in place for active beneficiaries while a lower court analyzes the Biden administration’s changes to the program. These included making the application for DACA and the work permit two separate processes, and implementing a public comment period to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. Our ruling Cortez Masto tweeted that Adam Laxalt is \"anti-DACA\" and \"fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general.\" Laxalt and 24 other attorneys general sued to stop the Obama administration from expanding DACA and creating a new program that would benefit parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. That lawsuit didn’t seek to revoke protections for people already in the program, but aimed to restrict the number of additional people who could benefit from it. It’s worth noting that Laxalt did not join another lawsuit to end the original version of DACA; he said it was because people were already enrolled in the program.

         "Ballots are “mailed unconstitutionally” to every voter in Colorado With Election Day nearing, the get-out-the vote effort is visible on social media, TV, radio and elsewhere. But some messages encouraging voter participation are also spreading misleading claims about mail-in voting. One such Instagram post showed a picture of a mail ballot from the Douglas County Clerk and Recorder in Castle Rock, Colorado. \"So when you get this … mailed unconstitutionally to every Colorado voter whether they requested one or not, ignore the instructions to vote early,\" the Oct. 22 post said. \"Vote in person, on Election Day, after reading the blue book to familiarize yourself with the issues.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) That’s because Colorado’s long-standing election procedures include sending mail ballot packets to every eligible voter — but that practice does not violate the state constitution. Mail ballots sent to all Colorado voters For nearly a decade, Colorado election officials have sent mail ballots to every registered, active voter. The practice became part of state law in 2013. Colorado’s constitution does not specifically address mail ballots or in-person voting. But Article VII, Section 8 says that all elections \"shall be by ballot, and in case paper ballots are required to be used, no ballots shall be marked in any way whereby the ballot can be identified as the ballot of the person casting it.\" Colorado Revised Statutes dictate mail voting procedures in detail: For general, primary, odd-year, coordinated, recall and congressional vacancy elections, C.R.S. 1-7.5-104 says \"the county clerk and recorder shall conduct the election by mail ballot\" under the secretary of state’s supervision and in accordance with state rules. To conduct a mail ballot election, C.R.S. 1-7.5-107 stipulates that designated election officials must send a mail ballot packet \"to each active registered elector, at the last mailing address appearing in the registration records.\" The ballot must be sent no more than 22 days before Election Day, but no fewer than 18 days before. About 98% of voters from all affiliations chose to vote by mail ballot in the last few elections, including the 2022 primary, said Annie Orloff, a spokesperson for the Colorado secretary of state. The state provides an automated way for voters to track their ballots from the time they are sent until they are accepted. Voting by mail is safe, secure Some Republicans have instructed voters to vote only in person at their polling place on Election Day, or to hold onto the ballots they’ve been mailed and drop them off in person on Election Day, rather than vote by mail. Featured Fact-check Mark Finchem stated on October 9, 2022 in a rally The Electronic Registration Information Center is “a system that’s funded by George Soros.” By Amy Sherman • October 17, 2022 This tactic is inspired by unsubstantiated and debunked claims that voting by mail invites significant fraud. United States Postal Service delivery vehicles drive in downtown Denver, June 1, 2022. In July 2022, officials said the USPS was creating a division to handle election mail issues as part of an effort to ensure swift and secure delivery of ballots for the 2022 midterm election. (AP) All voters must sign their names on their ballot and county officials use software and bipartisan election judge teams to compare signatures on ballots with signatures on state records, Colorado Public Radio reported. If signatures don’t match, county officials will text voters to verify their ballot signatures. \"If a voter doesn’t respond, the county will then refer the ballot to the local District Attorney’s office for investigation,\" the radio station reported. \"State records show fewer than 0.01% of ballots in elections are investigated for fraudulent signatures, though.\" In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced many states to try to run a presidential election largely by mail for the first time, many experts pointed to Colorado as a model for how such an election can work securely. Elena Nunez, the director of state operations and ballot measure strategies at Common Cause, said Colorado voters can choose to vote in a variety of ways, including returning their mail ballots by mail or to a drop box. Alternatively, people can go to a Vote Center from Oct. 24 until Election Day to cast their ballots. Our ruling An Instagram post said that ballots are \"mailed unconstitutionally\" to every voter in Colorado.

         "A video shows that a “Nuremberg 2.0 crimes against humanity trial starts Jan 2023. A video clip of Malcolm Roberts, a senator from Australia, talking about the COVID-19 pandemic is circulating on social media with text that appears to announce a big legal move. \"Nuremberg 2.0 crimes against humanity trial starts Jan 2023,\" the Oct. 23 Instagram post says. \"It’s become clear that people in this country and globally have been steamrolled,\" Roberts says in the clip. \"It is also clear that it has been coordinated globally. It is also clear that it has been integrated not just over six months, not just over 2.5 years, but it has been planned over decades. The changes to legislation in this country were done so that they could control doctors and people.\" Roberts also says \"the people that are guilty\" will be held accountable. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Nuremberg 2.0 is shorthand among conspiracy theorists for the criminal prosecution of world leaders for \"supposedly engineering a false pandemic,\" Vice has reported. It’s also a reference to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. Featured Fact-check Viral image stated on October 16, 2022 in an Instagram post “Covid vaccinations now prohibited in people under 50 in Denmark.” By Ciara O'Rourke • October 18, 2022 RELATED VIDEO As we’ve previously reported, the Nuremberg Code is a set of ethical rules for conducting human experiments created after World War II that includes the principle that humans should not be involuntarily subjected to medical experiments. It has been regularly cited in pandemic misinformation, including in debunked claims that COVID-19 vaccinations are a violation of the code. What’s more, contrary to Roberts’ claims in the video, the COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t fabricated. In 2020, efforts to downplay and deny its existence earned PolitiFact’s \"Lie of the Year.\" The video in the Instagram post shows an August event involving Roberts that was called \"The COVID Inquiry 2.0.\" Some speakers at the event were critical of the government’s pandemic restrictions and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. But it isn’t a sign that a crimes against humanity trial starts in January. We found no news reports, press releases or other sources to suggest a \"crimes against humanity trial\" is looming. The International Criminal Court investigates and tries individuals charged with crimes against humanity, among other offenses, and its prosecutor relies on the cooperation of countries around the world for support in making arrests and enforcing sentences.

         "Val Demings \"voted with Pelosi to raise taxes over $4,000 on Florida families. Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio accused his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Val Demings, of caring more about siding with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., than with the interests of Florida residents. A campaign ad running a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election said Demings \"voted with Pelosi to raise taxes over $4,000 on Florida families.\" Although it's unclear what legislation Rubio's ad is referring to, his campaign said the ad is referencing the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping law on health care, climate change and taxes. The legislation passed along party lines before President Joe Biden signed it into law in August. But did the Inflation Reduction Act impose a significant tax hike on ordinary Floridians, as Rubio’s ad suggested? Experts say it didn't. The law levied tax hikes on large corporations and high earners. The basis of Rubio's claim concerns the indirect impact of the law's effect on Florida taxpayers. But the ad doesn't mention subsidies included in the law that could mitigate the trickle-down effect of raising corporate taxes. Most analyses of the Inflation Reduction Act show a modest impact on taxpayers Rubio's campaign cited an article from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., that is critical of the Inflation Reduction Act. \"The Inflation Reduction Act is intended to raise taxes by roughly $570 billion over the next decade — $4,500 per household,\" the Heritage Foundation wrote. The article did not detail how it arrived at that number. Preston Brashers, a Heritage Foundation senior policy analyst, said the $4,500 figure is based on the sum of revenue brought in by the law's tax increases for corporations, stock owners and an increased budget for the IRS, among a few other taxes, divided by the number of U.S. households. The Heritage Foundation estimated the law’s tax provisions will result in $570 billion in new tax collections over the next decade; $570 billion divided by 128 million U.S. households equals around $4,500 per household. This guesswork is powered by several assumptions. Because the tax hikes are applied to corporations and stock owners, it’s unknown how average taxpayers will be affected. Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 \"Company ownership and stock ownership are not divided evenly among households,\" said John Buhl, senior communications manager with the independent Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington D.C. \"Even if you think a fairly large share of corporate taxes falls on workers and consumers, you wouldn't come up with numbers as large as what Heritage is claiming.\" The Inflation Reduction Act's impact on average taxpayers will come from secondary effects stemming from the increase in corporate taxes — which could include lower wages for workers. Such effects are difficult to measure. It’s also worth noting that the Heritage model did not account for the law's spending provisions that could cancel those tax increases. The Inflation Reduction Act includes subsidies for energy efficiency and clean energy, extends subsidies for insurance under the Affordable Care Act and eventually allows Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation, the Penn Wharton Budget Model and the Tax Foundation created model estimates of the Inflation Reduction Act; none predicted significant financial hits for consumers outside of higher-income households. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that the average U.S. household would see its after-tax income fall by 1.4% — and the decline would be less than 1% for people earning $30,000 to $100,000. This estimate did not factor in offsetting subsidies. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that favors deficit reduction, said the $64 billion in health insurance subsidies is \"more than enough\" to offset the after-tax income fall predicted by the Joint Commission on Taxation. Our ruling Rubio said Demings \"voted with Pelosi to raise taxes over $4,000 on Florida families.\" Rubio was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed with Pelosi and Demings' support. But the law does not include a blanket tax increase for Florida taxpayers. The law applied tax increases directly on very large corporations and high earners. It’s unclear whether and how corporations would pass those costs to consumers, and the individual effect of such increases will vary. The source of Rubio’s figure uses questionable methodology modeled over 10 years to measure the secondary effects passed down to U.S. households. Other analyses estimated the effects would be smaller and potentially offset by subsidies included in the law. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly Fals",

         "Cheri Beasley was “encouraging (riots) all across our state and all across our country in 2020. The Republican candidate for North Carolina’s open U.S. Senate seat says his Democratic opponent isn’t just soft on crime — she has encouraged criminal behavior. U.S. Rep. Ted Budd and Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former state Supreme Court chief justice, are running for the seat that will soon be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. In a debate hosted by Spectrum News on Oct. 7, Beasley pointed out that Budd voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, which she said was \"dangerous for this country.\" Budd responded by suggesting that Beasley excused violence that occurred when people protested police brutality in 2020. \"I have denounced violence from Day One,\" Budd said, \"whether it’s at Washington, D.C., or whether it’s the riots that my opponent was encouraging all across our state and all across our country in 2020.\" \"So, I believe whether it’s in Washington, D.C., at the Capitol, or whether it’s in downtown Raleigh or downtown Charlotte, I’m going to denounce violence and I would encourage my opponent to do the same thing and denounce the rioting.\" Did Beasley encourage riots in 2020? No. Protests erupted in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Floyd was a Black man who was killed in Minneapolis in May 2020 by a police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes during an attempted arrest. His death sparked nationwide protests against police abuses and energized a movement for racial justice. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder in 2021. At the time, Beasley was among the first state Supreme Court chief justices to speak out about racial injustices perpetuated by the judicial system. Republican groups have accused her of downplaying violence that happened during some of those protests. But Beasley never endorsed violence and pushed back against Budd’s claim on the debate stage. \"I have served as a judge in North Carolina for over 20 years and have upheld the rule of law. I would never encourage rioting and Congressman Budd knows that,\" she said. \"So, it’s also important that we have a senator that’s going to be willing to tell the truth.\" Beasley 2020 speech The Budd campaign cited two video clips of Beasley that have been tweeted and criticized by the Republican National Committee. On June 2, 2020, about a week after Floyd’s death, Beasley said she felt compelled to \"speak today about the pain and grief our nation is experiencing over the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and far too many others,\" she said. Taylor was killed by police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2020. Arbery was shot while jogging in a Georgia neighborhood in what the U.S. Justice Department described as a racially motivated hate crime. Video of Beasley’s speech is available online and a transcript is preserved on the North Carolina Judicial Branch website. The RNC tweeted the part of the speech in which Beasley calls on people to acknowledge the reasons why many people were protesting. \"It is shocking to see our workplaces, businesses and community spaces damaged,\" Beasley said. \"But we must recognize the legitimate pain and weight of years of disparate treatment that fuels these demonstrations. Featured Fact-check Tim Michels stated on October 24, 2022 in News conference Tony Evers “wants to let out between 9,000 and 10,000 more” Wisconsin prisoners By Madeline Heim • November 4, 2022 \"We must be willing to hear that message, even when we are saddened by the way it is delivered,\" she continued. \"We must decry the failures of justice and equity just as forcefully as we decry violence. It is not enough to say to protesters ‘go home and follow the rules.’ It’s not that simple.\" The Budd campaign cited this portion of Beasley’s speech as evidence the Democrat minimized the violence, her Senate campaign pointed to her call to forcefully \"decry violence\" as proof she discouraged it. Beasley 2020 interview The Budd campaign also cited an RNC tweet that features video from an interview that Beasley gave in September 2020 to a representative of The Mighty Sixth District of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. Randall Eaton, chairman of the fraternity’s voter-registration efforts, asked Beasley and other panelists to provide comments on the Black Lives Matter movement and violent unrest across the country. Beasley’s answer comes around the 44-minute mark of the video. Beasley tells Eaton that the protests had been \"fruitful\" because they created an opportunity for her to speak with high-powered attorneys about the need for diversity in their law firms. \"A lot of folks have been jolted into a very different reality,\" she said. \"Even as I talk with large partners in law firms to talk about the lack of diversity and how it’s been really important to make sure that you don’t just have two associates there with no support, that it’s really important that these associates have the same opportunities for partnership — just as those opportunities are available to Jim’s son down the hall. Those conversations already, in a short period of time, have been very fruitful.\" The video clip in the RNC tweet omits the first part of Beasley’s comments about promoting diversity in the legal community and starts playing when Beasley is in midthought: \"So, the protesting has been helpful. I’m sorry that there’s been an effort to be divisive around it, because I believe the protests have offered an opportunity to allow people to really think differently,\" she also said in the interview. She added: \"I understand that folks are concerned about violence and all of that. But that’s a (distraction) in my mind around what the real issues are. The folks who have been out there who have been peacefully protesting, which has really been the majority of folks, have every right to do that. They have the First Amendment right to do that and a Constitutional right to do that. And I believe that in so many ways those protests have been fruitful and have moved our nation forward. And I’m so proud especially of the young people who have used their voices in that way. What I am hopeful, though, is that they don’t stop speaking in those protests, that they have to understand that in order to really leverage the power that they have: it takes protests plus voting.\" Budd’s campaign says Beasley’s comments show she’s unwilling to discourage violence that occurs during protests of police brutality. \"As N.C. law enforcement officers were being violently threatened and small business owners in downtown Raleigh were seeing their livelihoods destroyed by rioters, Cheri Beasley encouraged the rioters by dismissing criticisms of their actions as a petty ‘distraction,’\" Budd adviser Jonathan Felts said in an email. \"If you’re rioting in the streets, and the chief justice of the state tells you any criticisms of your actions should be dismissed, that’s a green light to keep on rioting.\" Our ruling Budd says Beasley was \"encouraging (riots) all across our state and all across our country in 2020.\" In speaking about protests of police brutality, Beasley referred to violence a \"distraction\" and called on people to focus on the protestors’ reason for protesting. She said it’s \"not enough\" to tell protestors to \"go home and follow the rules.\" She also said violence should be decried and never explicitly encouraged it or even suggested that violence would lead to a change in police behavior.

         "Suggests that an immigrant charged with sexually assaulting a child entered the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration A political ad blasts President Joe Biden’s immigration record and points to the case of an immigrant accused of sexually assaulting a child as one example of his administration’s failings. \"Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats have erased our southern border and they have released a record number of illegal immigrants into the United States, all at your expense,\" a narrator says in a one-minute TV ad from the conservative nonprofit Citizens for Sanity. It continues, \"Mixed among the masses are drug dealers, sex traffickers and violent predators. One of these criminals raped a little girl. She was 3 years old … Who is Joe Biden letting into our country? Who are the Democrats bringing into our cities? And how many more kids will suffer?\" We’ve previously fact-checked the false claim that the southern border is open; the U.S. doesn’t have an \"open border\" policy. The ad is also misleading in its suggestion that an immigrant charged with sexually assaulting a 3-year-old entered the U.S. during Biden’s tenure as president. The man, Christopher Puente, has been in the U.S. since at least 2011 and was arrested several times over the years, including in 2019, when he was arrested and then released by Chicago police, according to arrest records and information from U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He has been jailed in relation to the sexual assault charges since February 2020. Citizens for Sanity did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. As the ad’s narrator talks about the sexual assault case, a photo of a man and a screenshot of a CBS News article appear on screen. The article details the February 2020 arrest of 34-year-old Puente, who was charged with one count of predatory criminal sexual assault. He is accused of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old girl at a McDonald’s in Chicago. The photo in the ad does not match a mugshot of Puente from the Chicago Police Department. Featured Fact-check Adam Laxalt stated on November 20, 2022 in an ad “Biden and Democrats have dismantled border security.” By Maria Ramirez Uribe • November 3, 2022 Puente has an arrest history in Chicago of at least six charges that date to 2016. Around the time of Puente’s 2020 arrest, ICE released a statement confirming that he was in the U.S. illegally. The statement said that in June 2019, after Puente was arrested in Chicago for theft, ICE \"lodged an immigration detainer with the Chicago Police Department.\" The detainer asked that ICE be notified in advance of Puente’s release and that he be briefly held by police so ICE could take custody of him. But \"that detainer was not honored,\" ICE said. According to the agency, Puente, who has used a variety of aliases, has felony convictions in the U.S. dating to 2011. There were previous efforts to deport Puente. In December 2014, he was deported to Mexico due to prior felony convictions. Five days later he reached the U.S. border and claimed to be a U.S. citizen. ICE said Puente was \"charged with falsely claiming citizenship and served a notice to appear before an immigration judge.\" Immigrants given these notices are allowed to remain in the U.S. while they await their court hearings. After Puente failed to appear for his immigration hearing in 2017, an immigration judge issued an order for his removal. Puente is still in custody on the sexual assault charges, per Cook County records. His next court date is in December. Despite the ad’s claims, a study from the University of Wisconsin–Madison found U.S. citizens are twice as likely to be arrested for violent felonies than immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Our ruling A Citizens for Sanity ad suggested an immigrant charged with sexually assaulting a child entered the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration. Puente has been in the U.S. since at least 2011 and was arrested several times over the years, including in 2019, when he was arrested and then released by Chicago police. He has been jailed in relation to the sexual assault charges since February 2020. We rate this claim Fals",

         "“Millions” of people from International Monetary Fund member countries are at risk of being placed in “COVID camps. Embattled conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is claiming on his social media accounts that private citizens around the world are at risk of being placed in \"COVID camps.\" Founder of the far-right conspiracy media organization InfoWars, Jones posited on his social platforms that citizens of International Monetary Fund member countries would be forced into quarantine housing. \"The COVID camps are here,\" Jones said in his Oct. 15 episode of \"The Alex Jones Show\", a clip of which was shared in an Oct. 16 Instagram post. \"Anyone against lockdowns and election fraud … are at risk of being placed into these camps.\" The measures, he added, stand to potentially affect \"millions and millions and millions of people.\" The post was flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The claim came days after a Connecticut jury ordered Jones to pay nearly $1 billion to the families of eight of 26 people killed in a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Jones has repeatedly falsely claimed the shooting was a hoax. By Jones’ logic, the COVID-19 virus is a man-made illness meant to infect conservatives who live in any of the 190 IMF member countries — which includes Canada, China and the United States — and ultimately force them to quarantine in designated pods away from the general public. In the video, Jones pointed to several headlines from news articles he suggested support his claim. Featured Fact-check Viral image stated on October 16, 2022 in an Instagram post “Covid vaccinations now prohibited in people under 50 in Denmark.” By Ciara O'Rourke • October 18, 2022 One, from a May 18 Bloomberg article, read, \"This is how China rounds up thousands of people for quarantine,\" one Bloomberg headline from a May 18 article reads. Another, from an 2020 Euronews article, read, \"What is life like inside Europe’s coronavirus quarantine centres?\" These articles do not say millions of private citizens are being admitted to centers due to political beliefs or attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines or mitigation measures, as Jones claimed. China has constructed \"centralized isolation facilities\" to provide 20,000 isolation beds across three sites, according to a report published by Bloomberg last month. Anyone who tests positive for the virus is required to sequester in one of these isolation facilities for at least a week, Bloomberg reported. Admission to these centers is not indefinite. The EuroNews article included a list of temporary quarantine set-ups at area hospitals across parts of Europe and the United Kingdom. People who were required to stay at these sites had traveled from China in February 2020 were required to do so for a two-week period. They were not remanded there permanently. He also showed a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document that has been falsely described as a plan to put \"high risk\" people in camps. It was updated in July 2020 and was titled \"Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.\" But it was a discussion document and stated that there was \"no empirical evidence\" that such an approach would reduce mortality from COVID-19 infections, and it emphasized the method’s inherent challenges and risks. There is no indication any of these efforts are part of a widespread international phenomenon affecting \"millions and millions and millions,\" as Jones claimed.

         "There were two shooters in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting About three years ago, on Oct. 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock shot into a country music concert crowd on the Las Vegas Strip from a Mandalay Bay hotel room, killing 60 people and injuring hundreds more. Joe Lombardo, the sheriff of Clark County, where Las Vegas is the county seat, and the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada, has said that the shooter acted alone. So did the state’s top FBI official. And yet, conspiracy theories continue to spread online that there was another shooter. One recent Instagram post wrongly claims the government orchestrated the shooting, and includes an old blog post claiming that \"close up video shows 2nd shooter firing out of the lower-level window at Mandalay Bay in Vegas.\" The post also has a video from the vantage point of a cab on the Las Vegas Strip. Gunshots can be heard and flashing lights from what appear to be floors below the 32nd floor, where police said Paddock was positioned. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The blog post in the Instagram post is no longer online. Featured Fact-check Viral image stated on October 23, 2022 in an Instagram post “Wikileaks releases moon landing cut scenes filmed in the Nevada desert.” By Ciara O'Rourke • October 25, 2022 Las Vegas police and the FBI investigated the shooting for 10 months, and when authorities released their final report in August 2018, Lombardo said the investigation revealed there were \"no other gunmen\" and that Paddock acted alone. He is the sole suspect listed in the investigative report, \"Despite early reports of multiple shooters in different locations, no evidence exists to substantiate any of those reports,\" the report says. \"Thousands of hours of digital media were reviewed, and after all the interviews were conducted, no evidence exists to indicate Paddock conspired with or acted in collusion with anyone else. This includes video surveillance, recovered DNA and analysis of cellular phones, and computers belonging to Paddock.\" As The New York Times noted in its 2017 debunk of claims that there were multiple shooters, the footage in the Instagram post doesn’t prove the hypothesis. \"The light and the gunshot sounds do not match\" in that video and another that circulated at the time,\" the Times said. \"And further, footage taken before and after the shooting shows that the light consistently flashed through the night.\" The light’s visible in this video posted on Instagram that was taken during a performance by country music duo Big and Rich, two hours before the shooting started.

         "“Mandela Barnes came out in favor of abortion up until the moment of birth. With less than three weeks left until the Nov. 8 election, abortion continues to figure at the forefront of major debates and talking points for the two candidates for U.S. Senate: Republican incumbent Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes, the lieutenant governor. For instance, we rated Pants on Fire a claim from Restoration PAC that Barnes supports killing \"preemies\" – infants born prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. And we rated Mostly False a claim from Barnes that, in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, \"Ron Johnson just came out in favor of a federal abortion ban.\" Now comes this claim from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, in an Oct. 6 news release: \"Mandela Barnes came out in favor of abortion up until the moment of birth.\" That’s not exactly true, either. The NRSC conflates, but Barnes’ stance has been unclear When asked for evidence, the committee, which works to elect Republicans to the U.S. Senate, pointed to two things directly tied to Barnes: a 2021 retweet and part of a speech he made at a Democratic Senate candidate forum sponsored by the Jewish Democratic Council of America in June of 2022. On Dec. 3, 2021, Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted: \"Right now, there's a bill in the Senate that would write Roe v. Wade into law. Let’s not wait any longer. Codify it. Pass the Women’s Health Protection Act now.\" That same day, Barnes retweeted it, adding this comment: \"What Senator Klobuchar said (with an arrow icon) we can’t wait any longer. Roe needs to be signed into law.\" The NRSC also cited this quote from the speech (the committee provided PolitiFact Wisconsin the video): \"With Roe under attack, we need to abolish the filibuster and we need to codify Roe v. Wade once and for all. I will tell you, to answer a previous question, I will never let archaic Senate procedure stand in the way of our basic human rights. We deserve elected leaders who will go to the mat to protect abortion rights and that is exactly what I will do.\" So, both cases amount to Barnes saying he wants to put into law the standards that existed under Roe v. Wade. But before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, there was not unfettered access to abortion up until birth. We noted in an Oct. 4 fact-check that \"seeking to make Roe the law of the land is not the same as supporting abortion up until birth.\" The item noted: \"Even when Roe was in place, it didn’t greenlight abortion at any time during a pregnancy. It included a viability restriction, asserting that states couldn’t impose significant restrictions on abortion access before the fetus became viable — usually around 24 weeks’ gestational age. Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 25, 2022 in an Instagram post The documentary “2,000 Mules proves” Democrats “cheated on the 2020 elections.” By Jon Greenberg • October 28, 2022 \"Most states — including Wisconsin — prohibited abortion, except in medical emergencies, after viability or even earlier in the pregnancy.\" What’s more, the NRSC was unable to point directly to any statements in which Barnes says what they say he said. Nor have they cited any recent change in position as the claim suggests. The closest they have cited is an article posted Oct. 5 by the Eau Claire Leader Telegram which noted of Barnes: \"In questions with the media after the session, Barnes rejected the idea of a timeframe cap where abortion would be banned, whether it is 16 weeks, 20 weeks, or later into a pregnancy.\" It was a paraphrase of whatever was stated. The Barnes campaign said they did not have audio of the exchange. So, in short, Barnes has not done himself any favors when it comes to clarity on this particular point. After the Oct. 7 debate between Barnes and Johnson, when WISN-TV asked Barnes whether he supported a woman being allowed an abortion up until birth, Barnes’ response was: \"Well, I'll tell you that's a decision that should be made between a woman (and) her doctor, I don't have the medical credentials to make that decision.\" Then asked if that was \"yes or a no,\" he said: \"I think most members of Congress don't have the medical credentials to make that decision. And unfortunately, we have uninformed people who get to impose their own personal views on women and that's just not right.\" After several requests to clarify the position, Maddy McDaniel, Barnes’ spokesperson, sent us a statement that criticized Johnson and \"D.C. cronies\" who are backing him and included this: \"Lt. Governor Barnes does not support abortion up until birth — he would vote to codify Roe v. Wade, which ensured women and doctors have the freedom to make the decisions that protect their health and safety.\" Our ruling The NRSC claimed Barnes \"came out in favor of abortion up until the moment of birth.\" The evidence provided by the NRSC does not support the claim they made, but rather conflates both the issue of Roe v. Wade and abortion up until the moment of birth. That being said, Barnes has turned away opportunities to make his views even more clear, and by — according to the Eau Claire report — rejecting a cap, leaves listeners fuzzy at best. Finally, as we noted in the Barnes v. Johnson item, there is no recent change in position, as the claim suggests. Our definition of Mostly False is \"The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s what we rate this claim. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND'; window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false; window.gciAnalytics.view({ 'event-type': 'pageview', 'content-type': 'interactives', 'content-ssts-section': 'news', 'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics', 'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin', 'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin' });",

         "Suggests fentanyl, not Derek Chauvin, killed George Floy Soon after announcing he would acquire social media platform Parler and making antisemitic comments, Kanye West was back in the news — this time for claiming that George Floyd was not killed by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. West, who legally changed his name to Ye, sat down for an Oct. 16 interview on the podcast Drink Champs, where he brought up conservative commentator Candace Owens’ recent documentary about Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. \"They hit him with the fentanyl. If you look, the guy’s knee wasn’t even on his neck like that,\" West said. West’s comments received widespread backlash, and the interview was removed from Drink Champs’ website, YouTube, Apple Music and Spotify. The podcast’s co-host, rapper N.O.R.E., apologized for giving West a platform. Though the original podcast has been removed, clips from the interview continue to circulate online. We reached out to lawyers who previously represented West for comment, but received no response. Featured Fact-check Tim Michels stated on October 24, 2022 in News conference Tony Evers “wants to let out between 9,000 and 10,000 more” Wisconsin prisoners By Madeline Heim • November 4, 2022 There is overwhelming evidence to disprove West’s claim. While providing testimony during Chauvin’s criminal trial, prosecution witnesses said they watched police body cam footage of the incident and saw that Chauvin applied pressure continuously to Floyd’s neck or neck area. Two autopsy reports ruled that the cause of Floyd’s death was homicide by asphyxiation, or suffocation. Floyd was killed when Chauvin pinned his knee to Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin was convicted of three counts of unintentional second-degree murder, third degree murder and second degree manslaughter. Floyd did have fentanyl in his system at the time of his death, as West said. However, the Hennepin County, Minnesota, medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was homicide, because of \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Experts in toxicology, cardiology and drug use stated death by overdose was unlikely or impossible. The lawyer for Floyd’s family said Oct. 16 that the family would sue West for his comments. The mother of Floyd’s daughter also filed to sue West for $250 million for \"harassment, misappropriation, defamation and infliction of emotional distress.\" Floyd’s brother is also considering a lawsuit. West suggested that fentanyl, not Chauvin, killed Floyd. We rate that claim False",

         "In Texas, a person can register a dead relative to vote and then cast a mail ballot in their name When family members die, mail addressed to them can continue to arrive for years. A Facebook post suggests that this is a path to voter fraud. A Facebook user copied a post from a man in Texas who said the campaign for Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic candidate for governor, sent a voter registration form to his mother, even though she died in 2020. The post said much of his mother’s identifying information, including date of birth, was already filled in on the form. A \"dishonest recipient\" could submit the voter registration form to the county and \"register the deceased to vote,\" the Facebook post stated. \"They then can request a mail ballot. With the numbers already provided for ID, they then can vote for the deceased person. No picture ID required.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook.) It’s possible to try to register a dead relative to vote — but it’s a crime. As in other states, Texas election officials take a lot of steps to ensure that only eligible living citizens register to vote and cast ballots. From the photos in the post, we could not see a disclaimer on the mailer to assess if it was from O’Rourke’s campaign or a third party group supporting his campaign; O’Rourke’s campaign didn’t respond to our emails. We aren’t questioning whether a voter registration application was sent to a woman who had died. We are fact-checking how likely it is that someone could use that application to register a dead person to vote and then cast a ballot on that person’s behalf. Evidence shows cases in multiple states of people prosecuted for casting a ballot in the name of a dead relative, but the examples are rare. Texas officials vet voter registration applications against records When Texans submit a voter registration application, it includes their name, date of birth, driver’s license number or four digits of their Social Security number. That information is entered into the state’s database and is then compared with records from the Texas Department of Public Safety and U.S. Social Security Administration. If the identifying information matches a person who is listed in state or federal records as deceased, it \"would fail the validation process,\" said Sam Taylor, spokesperson for the Texas secretary of state. The secretary of state’s office receives information weekly or monthly regarding people who have died, depending upon the data. That information is forwarded to county voter registrars so that they can remove those people from their rolls of eligible voters. In 2022, at least 9,000 dead voters were removed from the Texas voting rolls each month. Despite best efforts, the process isn’t perfect. If an election official updates a voter roll on a Friday, by Monday it may already be outdated because of people who have moved or died. Sometimes databases used by campaign vendors or nonprofits to send mail are not up to date or accurate, resulting in a mail ballot application being sent to someone who died — or even to a dead pet. But there is no evidence that campaigns or activists are submitting application forms on behalf of dead voters, said Thessalia Merivaki, an assistant professor of American politics at Mississippi State University. Featured Fact-check Mark Finchem stated on October 9, 2022 in a rally The Electronic Registration Information Center is “a system that’s funded by George Soros.” By Amy Sherman • October 17, 2022 \"We have no complete data on this from all states, but election officials track internally why an application is denied and states have policies to pursue cases of fraudulent registrations,\" Merivaki said. If someone did attempt to register a dead relative, that application would most likely be rejected, said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a group that advocates for voting access. If a dead person did make it onto the voter rolls, \"the person attempting to impersonate the deceased person would still have to navigate identification requirements, signature verification, and the possibility that the voter registration would be flagged once the appropriate databases did get updated,\" Gutierrez said. \"The odds of this person successfully casting a ballot for their dead relative are extremely low, and the odds of them using this ploy to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of an election are practically zero, whereas their odds of getting themselves into very serious legal trouble and probably spending some time in prison would be extremely high,\" Gutierrez said. Voter registration applications say that giving false information is a crime punishable by fines and up to one year in jail. The same applies for mail ballot applications. Texas election officials take steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast mail ballots. Only voters who meet specific criteria can vote by mail, such as those who are at least 65 years old, are out of town during the voting period or who have a disability. There may be limited circumstances in which someone tries to \"game\" the system, but it should be caught in officials’.regular updates of the voter rolls to remove dead individuals. Ballots cast on behalf of dead voters rarely occur Convictions for ballots cast in the name of a dead relative are rare in any state. In 2020, a Nevada man, Donald Kirk Hartle, said that someone cast a ballot in the name of his dead wife. Turns out, it was him. He pleaded guilty to one count of voting more than once in an election. We found other isolated convictions for casting a ballot on behalf of a dead relative in Pennsylvania, Florida and Arizona in the 2020 election. What about Texas? In 2012, Gov. Greg Abbott said 200 dead people voted in a previous election. An elections official testified that 239 voters cast ballots using voter registrations of dead Texans. But when the state further vetted that list, ultimately only four names, birth dates and Social Security numbers aligned with death certificates. As PolitiFact Texas noted at the time, there’s a difference between suspecting fraud and proving it. Our ruling A Facebook post suggests that a person can register a dead relative to vote in Texas and then cast a mail ballot in that person’s name. It does appear some voter registration applicants have been sent to people who have died, and a nefarious person could attempt to register a dead person to vote. But this Facebook post is missing context because it overlooks the checks and balances in place to prevent exactly this scenario. When officials receive a voter registration application, they enter the applicant’s name, age, birth date, driver’s license number or Social Security number into a database. They compare that personal information with potential matches in other databases of people who have died. When there is a match, the applicant is not registered to vote. It is a crime to sign a voter registration form with false information, seek a mail ballot on behalf of a dead person, or return a ballot on behalf of a dead person. We rate this statement Mostly False.

         "The Electronic Registration Information Center is “a system that’s funded by George Soros. Mark Finchem, the Republican running for Arizona secretary of state, has falsely linked liberal billionaire George Soros and an organization that helps states clean up voter rolls. Finchem said if he is elected, he will withdraw Arizona from the Electronic Registration Information Center, known as ERIC. States that are part of the organization can access other member states’ voter registration and driver's license data. Election officials can then use that information to remove from voter rolls the names of people who have died or moved. \"We need to get out of ERIC, a system that’s funded by George Soros,\" Finchem said Oct. 9 at an event also attended by former President Donald Trump to rally for Arizona Republicans running for office. If Finchem becomes secretary of state he would have the authority to give written notice to drop out of ERIC. But he is wrong to say the partnership is funded by Soros; the member states fund ERIC. Finchem, a state lawmaker, faces Democrat Adrian Fontes in the November election. Fontes is a former Maricopa County election official who lost re-election in 2020 to Republican Stephen Richer. Finchem is part of the America First coalition of secretary of state candidates who have run on the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. The group has been influenced by a key figure in the QAnon conspiracy theory movement. Republicans running for secretary of state in Nevada and Michigan have also falsely claimed ERIC is backed by Soros. One of America First’s platforms is to enact \"aggressive voter roll cleanup.\" Their stance against ERIC ignores that its purpose is to help states do a better job at cleaning up voter rolls. We contacted Finchem through his campaign website and did not get a response. Electronic Registration Information Center created to help states clean voter rolls There is no national database of voters, which means that states and local jurisdictions are responsible for maintaining up-to-date voter rolls. Keeping voter rolls up to date is a challenge because when people move, they often don’t alert their local elections office. Even though officials routinely update their voter rolls, the rolls are constantly changing, including because of voters who die. To tackle those challenges, seven states formed ERIC in 2012 with $139,000 in startup funds from the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts. Thirty-three states and Washington, D.C., are members of ERIC. The states are roughly evenly divided between those with Republican and Democratic state election officials, according to ERIC. States’ money keeps ERIC going Today, member states fund ERIC. New members pay a one-time fee of $25,000 to help cover expenses for technology upgrades and expansions necessary to support a growing membership. Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 25, 2022 in an Instagram post The documentary “2,000 Mules proves” Democrats “cheated on the 2020 elections.” By Jon Greenberg • October 28, 2022 States also pay annual dues based in part on the voting age population in each state. Members approve the dues and the annual budget. Dues for the 2022-23 fiscal year range from about $26,000 to about $116,000. At least every 60 days, each member state submits its voter registration data, licensing and identification data from motor vehicle departments to ERIC. ERIC generates reports that identify voters who moved within the state, voters who moved to another ERIC state, voters who died, and voters with duplicate registrations in the same state. Since 2013, ERIC has identified more than 25 million voters who fall into one of these categories. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, a Republican, called assertions that ERIC is a Soros-funded leftist group \"patently false.\" In an Alabama Today op-ed in February, Merrill wrote that since Alabama joined ERIC in 2016, it had identified more than 222,000 voter records of potential cross-state movers plus tens of thousands of voters who had died or had duplicate registrations. The falsehood that ERIC is funded by Soros appears to have originated with stories by the conservative website The Gateway Pundit in January. One of those stories pointed to a document showing a Soros organization gave money to the Pew Charitable Trusts, but the document says the funding was for \"voting rights\" — not for ERIC. The Pew Charitable Trusts received grants from Soros’ Foundation to Promote Open Society from 2009 to 2011. The money helped fund the Voting Information Project, which gives voters information about where to vote and what’s on the ballot. That project is unrelated to ERIC and was later taken over by another group, Democracy Works. Pew gave ERIC a $288,000 grant in 2019 for information technology upgrades. Our ruling Finchem said that the Electronic Registration Information Center is \"a system that’s funded by George Soros.\" ERIC is a partnership among 33 states that are led by Democrats and Republicans. The group shares voter registration data to keep voter rolls up to date. It is funded by member states who pay an upfront fee to join and by annual dues. States formed ERIC in 2012 with start-up funds from the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts. A Soros organization gave money to Pew between 2009 and 2011, but it was for a separate, unrelated project.

         "Says Adam Laxalt said it is “good news” that “a lot of those Hispanic small businesses never reopened” after the pandemic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate, claims that her Republican opponent cheered the loss of jobs and Latino businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her 15-second Spanish-language video ad begins with images of two blue-collar workers behind these words: \"Adam Laxalt speaking about Nevada's Latino small businesses.\" An audio clip of Laxalt speaking plays as his photo appears on the screen. He says in English (with Spanish captions): \"I think the good news is that now we’re a year, a lot of those jobs never came back, a lot of those Hispanic small businesses never reopened.\" Then words on the screen say: \"Adam Laxalt is not on our side.\" Reinforcing the claim is a caption below the video that has the same text that Cortez Masto posted with the ad on Facebook: \"Adam Laxalt said it was ‘good news’ that Latino small businesses suffered during the pandemic because he thought it would benefit him politically. He is not fighting for Nevada, only for himself.\" Cortez Masto’s claim that Laxalt hailed the loss of jobs and Hispanic businesses is based on how she stripped away the context of his remarks. Laxalt was cheering that, in his view, voters came around to blaming Democrats for the losses. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund estimated in February that 16.6% of Nevada voters in the Nov. 8 election will be Latinos. The toss-up Nevada race could decide which political party controls the Senate, which is split 50-50. Context of Laxalt’s remark The Laxalt clip came from the Jan. 28 edition of the \"Steak for Breakfast Podcast,\" which included an exchange showing that what Laxalt was happy about was not the loss of jobs and businesses, but what he said was voters’ recognition that Democratic policies had caused the losses. We put in bold type the Laxalt remarks that were used in the ad. Laxalt: \"You think about how bizarre 2020 was — Host: \"Yeah.\" Laxalt: \"— that we have COVID crashing, you’ve got blue states that are basically not allowing (President Donald Trump) to visit and deliver a message, our Democrat governor (Steve Sisolak) shut down the state. And you know, I called as early as May (2020), that we shouldn’t be shut down. The state can’t be shut down. You can leave it up to individual businesses, people can make their own decisions. But of course, they plowed directly on. And then what do they do with that? We lose so many jobs in Southern Nevada —\" Featured Fact-check Adam Laxalt stated on November 20, 2022 in an ad “Biden and Democrats have dismantled border security.” By Maria Ramirez Uribe • November 3, 2022 Host: \"Yeah.\" Laxalt: \"All of those Strip jobs are lost. And so I’m thinking, all right, well, finally, all these voters are going to blame the Democrats for these terrible lockdown policies, right? Well, you guys may remember the Democrats’ message at the time was: Donald Trump’s fault. He’s not doing enough for COVID.\" Host: \"Yep.\" Laxalt: \"It’s his fault why you lost your job. And I was thinking at the time, like, ‘God, there’s no way anyone’s going to buy that.’ But, apparently, some slice of voters really thought it was his fault. \"I think the good news is that now we’re a year, a lot of those jobs never came back, a lot of those Hispanic small businesses never reopened, and guess who is in charge? We have a Democrat governor, a Democrat House, a Democrat Assembly, a Democrat president, Democrat Senate, Democrat House of Representatives. And it’s 100% their fault. And so the media can’t cover for them. They’re going to try, we all know, but the media can’t do what it did in 2020 and basically blame the pandemic on Republicans. And so, we’re seeing an awakening here … \"But, here we are. And I think the good news is, while some of this is doom and gloom, I’m not happy it took so long for people to come around. But boy, are people coming around. People are really waking up to the, all of these hypocrites and all the different rules they play by, then they expect all of us to play by, and they know that it’s hurting our kids.\" In context, Laxalt’s repeated use of \"good news\" refers to the upside of Nevadans realizing that Democrats’ pandemic policies are responsible for the shuttered Hispanic businesses. Earlier in the campaign, the Nevada Democratic Victory organization made the same claim that Laxalt celebrated the Latino businesses’ closure using the same Laxalt clip. Cortez Masto’s campaign linked to that claim in news releases. Cortez Masto’s campaign told PolitiFact that Laxalt was arguing that businesses closing was \"good news\" because Democrats would shoulder the blame. Laxalt’s campaign said the \"good news\" is in reference to Democrats in Washington and Nevada being, in his view, responsible for hurting businesses. Our ruling Cortez Masto’s ad said Laxalt called it \"good news\" that \"a lot of those Hispanic small businesses never reopened\" after the pandemic. Pitching to a Spanish-speaking audience, the ad makes it seem as though Laxalt was happy to see Hispanic businesses fail. That wasn’t his point. The ad leaves out that in his stuttered response, Laxalt said it was \"good news\" that voters would blame Democratic leaders — and no longer blame Republican President Donald Trump — for lost jobs and closed businesses that remained a year into the pandemic. He said it was wrong for voters to continue to blame Trump with Democrats in charge of state and national governments. He didn’t welcome lost Hispanic jobs. We rate Cortez Masto’s distorted claim False. RELATED: Catherine Cortez Masto’s PolitiFact file RELATED: Adam Laxalt’s PolitiFact file RELATED: Fact-checking ads in the 2022 campaig",

         "“Tim Ryan when he ran for president two years ago … supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking. The candidates in one of the nation’s hottest midterm races — the contest for an open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio — came out swinging in an Oct. 10 debate, with Republican J.D. Vance and Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan accusing each other of being dishonest. Here, we’ll examine an exchange involving Ryan’s stance on natural gas production. It’s an issue of importance to Ohio, which ranks as the nation’s sixth-biggest producer of natural gas. Vance raised energy policy in the debate’s opening exchange, saying that Democrats have \"gone to war\" against the domestic energy sector. Ryan countered by citing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed Aug. 16, that Ryan said go \"all in on natural gas.\" He continued, \"I’ve been a natural gas proponent since I’ve been in Congress. And we have to get this right. We need to increase our production of natural gas. I support streamlining the permitting process around natural gas so we can get it around the country, lower costs for businesses, and ship it to Europe to stick our finger in Vladimir Putin’s eye.\" Vance, however, wasn’t buying Ryan’s claim that he’s championed natural gas production. Vance said, \"Tim Ryan just told a big fib. He said he supported Ohio’s natural gas industry and he’s always done so. And yet Tim Ryan when he ran for president, two years ago, you supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.\" Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, injects water, chemicals and sand at ultrahigh pressure to crack open rock layers and release trapped natural gas. The method has enabled the United States to become a world leader in natural gas production, but it has also caused controversy among environmentalists and local residents’ groups, who argue its chemicals can pollute the environment and seep into water supplies. Environmentalists also worry that fracking can trigger earthquakes. Responding to Vance, Ryan countered, \"You could go back my entire career. We have two natural gas power plants in my congressional district that I helped us get. And the union that works in the natural gas industry endorsed me. Do you think they’re going to endorse me if I’m for banning fracking? It’s just not true.\" JD VANCE: \"Tim Ryan just told a big fib. He said he supported Ohio's natural gas industry and he's always done so.\"\"When he ran for president, just two years ago, you supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.\" pic.twitter.com/JtOY9FmpSZ— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) October 10, 2022 So what’s going on here? We found that both sides are engaging in some spin. Ryan said he ‘absolutely’ would consider banning fracking on federal lands Ryan expressed an openness to banning fracking in 2019, when he was running a short-lived campaign for president. The comment came during a joint forum on climate change with another longshot primary candidate, then-Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, in the early primary state of New Hampshire. During a question-and-answer session, an audience member introduced herself as a participant in a local group that was fighting a pipeline for fracked natural gas. She asked, \"If elected, would you consider banning fracking on federal lands?\" Featured Fact-check Tim Ryan stated on November 1, 2022 in a town hall event “J.D. Vance said nothing about” the attack on Paul Pelosi. By Jon Greenberg • November 3, 2022 Ryan responded, \"Absolutely. Absolutely. On federal lands. I see the natural gas piece as a transition for us,\" from fossil fuels to renewable energy. After the debate, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, noted that Ryan in 2017 joined most Democrats in supporting an amendment to an appropriations bill to bar the spending of federal funds on the processing of drilling permits applications for fracking in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf. The amendment did not address permits on nonfederal lands. Vance’s campaign pointed PolitiFact to comments Ryan made to The Washington Post about regulating fracking to prevent environmental damage. \"If the industry cannot rapidly innovate on these issues, I believe the federal government would need to step in and halt fracking operations,\" Ryan said in 2020. Ryan’s broader record shows support for regulated fracking Ryan’s statement during the 2019 forum came in response to a question about banning fracking on federal lands only. The questioner did not ask Ryan about the possibility of banning fracking everywhere, and asked only whether he’d \"consider\" the move. The 2017 amendment Ryan supported would have paused fracking on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf, in sensitive environmental waters off California, thousands of miles from Ohio and any land-based fracking operations there. Ryan’s 2020 comments to the Post were focused on ensuring that local households aren’t hurt by fracking. Ryan told the Post that despite his environmental concerns, fracking \"has provided enormous economic benefits and moved the U.S. towards energy independence.\" Ryan also told the Post the industry needed more oversight and regulation, \"especially in regard to its use and disposal of water, as well as methane leaks. ... If the industry cannot rapidly innovate on these issues, I believe the federal government would need to step in and halt fracking operations.\" This line of argument — that fracking is economically valuable but needs to be regulated for its environmental risks — is bolstered by legislation Ryan co-sponsored in 2018, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals, or FRAC, Act. The measure, which did not pass, required disclosure of the chemicals used in fracking fluids and removed the oil and gas industry's exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act. This would allow the industry to continue operating, but in a more regulated manner. Ryan’s support for it complicates Vance’s argument that he wants to simply ban fracking. Ryan has also spoken favorably about fracking during his Senate campaign. In April 2022, Ryan praised the local natural gas extraction economy in eastern Ohio, which fracking enabled. \"This is a hell of an opportunity for eastern Ohio to sell natural gas to Eastern Europe and knock Vladimir Putin’s legs out from under him,\" Ryan said. \"This needs to be a key part of our global strategy, and it’s about jobs, you know, good family wages here, good union jobs here in eastern Ohio. And I’m all for it and I’ll do anything I can to help with this project and any other project we can establish here.\" Our ruling Vance said that Ryan, \"when he ran for president, two years ago ... supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.\" Ryan said during a 2019 event that he would \"absolutely\" consider banning fracking on federal lands. He also voted to stop the processing of fracking applications for drilling sites off the California coast in environmentally sensitive water. Ryan told The Washington Post that if the fracking industry cannot keep local residents safe, the federal government might need to \"halt\" fracking operations. However, Ryan’s full record of statements and policies on fracking is more nuanced than Vance suggests. Ryan’s focus has been on leveraging natural gas as a transitional fuel and a source of revenue and jobs for Ohio. He’s said he supports fracking as long as the industry keeps the environmental risks in check. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True",

         "Parasite cleanses \"kill herpes by starving the parasites in the stomach. There is no known cure for herpes, but an Instagram post claims that's not the case and that a parasite cleanse can do the trick. \"Parasite cleanses\" are widely shared on social media, and posts touting the cleanses claim without proof that many health issues, both real and imaginary, stem from parasitic infections. One Sept. 28 Instagram post claims that parasite cleanses \"kill herpes by starving the parasites in the stomach,\" and the caption points viewers to a website selling the cleanses and other homeopathic treatments. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The video’s claims are rooted in pseudoscience. A parasitic diseases expert told PolitiFact the cleanses are ineffective and can harm a person’s health. What are parasites? Parasites are organisms of varying sizes that can infect people and cause disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The three classes of parasites can infect humans through fecal-oral transmission, typically from food or water contaminated with fecal matter; from exposure to a parasite’s eggs or larvae as a result of poor personal hygiene or consuming contaminated food or water; and by burrowing into humans’ skin, such as with fleas, lice and ticks. Despite the video’s claims, herpes is not a result of parasitic infection. It is caused by two viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, and spread by skin-to-skin contact with an infected area. Also contrary to the video’s claims, eczema and dandruff are not forms of herpes that are related to parasites; they are noncontagious skin conditions. It’s unknown what causes eczema, though environment and genetics may be contributing factors. Similarly, it’s unknown what causes dandruff. It’s believed that dry skin, oily skin, skin sensitivity or a yeastlike fungus may be factors. Can a parasite cleanse help? Shira Shafir, an associate professor of epidemiology and community health sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the cleanses do not include any ingredient capable of killing a parasite. Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 10, 2022 in a post “Premature babies are at a much higher risk of injury from immunizations than full-term babies.” By Andy Nguyen • October 13, 2022 They are considered herbal remedies and not pharmaceuticals, so the Food and Drug Administration doesn’t closely regulate the cleanses. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 puts the burden of testing a supplement, its safety and the effectiveness of its remedy on the producer. \"There’s nobody overseeing the ingredients that are in there and whether they are what they claim to be and whether they’re safe for human consumption,\" Shafir said. She said the cleanses often cause an increase in bowel movements, which gives the illusion of expelling something harmful from the body. In reality, the parasite cleanses can harm a person’s gut and electrolyte balance. People using parasite cleanses are likely self-diagnosing and not infected with a parasite, Shafir said. Shafir said though the cleanses claim to treat parasitic worms, it is \"exceptionally rare\" to contract the worms in the U.S. and other developed nations. In the U.S. and other developed nations, it’s much more common to get microscopic parasites through fecal-oral transmission. Diagnosing and treating a parasitic infection requires visiting a medical professional and taking an antiparasitic drug. The medications are highly effective and are prescribed in specific doses based on a person's weight and type of infection. Our ruling A video shared on Instagram claimed parasite cleanses kill herpes by starving the parasites in the stomach. Parasitic cleanses don’t contain any ingredient that could kill a parasite, and the cleanses can harm a person’s health. We rate this claim Pants on Fir",

         "Wiley Nickel supports “abortion all the way up until the point of birth, even post-birth. North Carolina Republican congressional candidate Bo Hines is accusing his opponent of supporting \"abortion all the way up until the point of birth, even post-birth.\" Hines, a political newcomer who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, faces Democratic state Sen. Wiley Nickel in what’s expected to be the most competitive congressional race in the state. WRAL-TV, a PolitiFact partner, recently interviewed the candidates as part of its \"On the Record\" television show and asked each candidate about his position on abortion. Hines said he opposes abortion unless a woman’s life is at risk or if the mother is a young victim of rape or incest. For older sexual assault victims, Hines said the legality of abortion should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. \"My position is much less radical than my opponent’s position, which is really abortion all the way up until the point of birth, even post-birth,\" Hines said. But is Hines’ characterization of Nickel’s abortion stance accurate? No. Nickel said he wants to codify into federal law the rights established by the landmark Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey rulings, and earlier this year sponsored a bill in the state Senate to do just that. The bill would allow the state to restrict abortions up until fetal viability, which typically happens around 23 or 24 weeks into a pregnancy. It would allow later abortions only in cases when the procedure is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Late-term abortions are rare. Procedures conducted after 21 weeks of pregnancy accounted for 1% of all abortions in 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those occur because the fetus is no longer viable or the mother’s health is threatened, experts have told PolitiFact. There is no evidence Nickel supports what Hines described as \"post-birth\" abortion. Killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Nickel is no exception. ‘Born alive’ bill To support Hines’ claim that Nickel supports \"post-birth\" abortion, his campaign cited Nickel’s vote on North Carolina Senate Bill 349 in 2019. The bill was known as the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and would’ve amended the state’s existing murder statute to specifically address a situation where care is withheld from a child who was born alive during an attempted abortion. The bill featured new punishments for physicians and nurses who didn’t comply with the law, or who failed to report noncompliance. They could’ve faced felony charges, prison time and up to $250,000 in fines. The Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, but it never became law because Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Nickel said he opposed the bill at the time because existing laws already made it a crime to kill a newborn baby, regardless of the circumstance. In an April 2019 tweet, Nickel said the bill would \"demonize and criminalize\" doctors and nurses. Featured Fact-check Kari Lake stated on October 9, 2022 in an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation “Katie Hobbs voted for allowing a baby who survives an abortion — that the hospital would refuse medical care and allow the baby to die on a cold metal tray.” By Jon Greenberg • October 12, 2022 PolitiFact North Carolina previously fact-checked multiple claims about the proposed \"born alive\" bill. If a baby does survive an abortion attempt and is alive outside its mother’s womb, legal experts say it’s entitled to the same legal protections as an infant born in any other circumstance. \"If you have a baby born alive, it doesn’t matter if it was born from a failed abortion or otherwise … it’s entitled to full constitutional protections,\" Neil Siegel, a lawyer and professor at Duke Law School, said at the time. A spokesman for Republican Senate Leader Phil Berger also acknowledged in 2019 that, \"In theory, a medical professional could be charged with manslaughter for withholding care.\" \"We would not be permitted, under current law, to neglect a baby that was born and needed care,\" Jonas Swartz, a physician and assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine, told PolitiFact NC in an email. \"To do so would also not be consistent with principles of medical ethics.\" Nickel, Democrats respond Nickel campaign manager Abby May disputed Hines’ characterization. \"To be clear, Wiley does not support abortion up until the moment of birth,\" May said. \"He thinks women and doctors should make these decisions, not the 27-year-old former football player who thinks that he has the right to tell women what to do with their bodies.\" Hines, 27, played collegiate football at North Carolina State and Yale. Apart from citing the \"born alive\" bill, Hines’ campaign didn’t elaborate on Hines’ claim about Nickel or the Nickel campaign’s response. When pressed about his \"post-birth abortion\" comment during the show, Hines said: \"Wiley is endorsed by the progressive caucus, he sought that endorsement. And, you know, if there’s an abortion procedure that happens when the baby comes out and is still alive, many in that caucus have said they would support allowing the baby to suffocate on the table.\" The Progressive Caucus, part of the North Carolina Democratic Party, did endorse Nickel. But Ryan Jenkins, the caucus president, told PolitiFact NC the caucus has never supported abortion after birth. \"Further, if anyone was in favor of that, I would tell them to get out of the caucus immediately,\" Jenkins said. Dan Blue is the Senate minority leader for the Democrats. Leslie Edwards, Blue’s communications director, also said she’s not aware of any time a member has supported abortion after birth. Our ruling Hines said Nickel supports abortion \"all the way up until the point of birth, even post-birth.\" This claim ignores Nickel’s stated goal of codifying Roe, which would grant the right to an abortion up to the point of viability. In cases in which complications arise, Nickel says he believes decisions are best left to a mother and her doctor. Although Nickel opposed a GOP-backed bill termed the \"born alive\" bill, he did so on grounds that existing laws already made it a crime to kill a newborn baby, regardless of the circumstance. There is no evidence he supports \"post-birth\" abortion. We rate this claim Fals",

         "“Norway readies its military to counter Biden. Following the discovery of a series of gas leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline network in the Baltic Sea, Norway deployed its military to gas processing plants to protect the flow of resources coming from Russia to Europe. European authorities believe the pipeline leaks were deliberately made but have not identified any suspects. That didn’t stop a Facebook post from blaming the United States. \"Norway readies its military to counter Biden,\" the Oct. 5 post claimed.

It showed a news report from TFI Global, an India-based media company that describes itself as providing an \"alternate non-mainstream narrative to news lovers.\" A woman in the video claimed the U.S. wants to \"destroy Europe,\" first by prolonging the war between Russia and Ukraine, then by attacking the Nord Stream network. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook.) Although the investigation into the leaks continues, suspects haven’t been named. And there is no evidence that Norway employed its military \"to counter Biden.\" Here’s what we know. The pipeline leaks Four separate leaks were reported Sept. 26 from the Nord Stream pipelines following a series of underwater explosions. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are natural gas pipelines from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Featured Fact-check Viral image stated on October 22, 2022 in an Instagram post A CNN headline shows Uganda’s president saying he doesn’t support Ukraine because it would be “disgusting.” By Ciara O'Rourke • October 24, 2022 Danish and Swedish authorities have been investigating the leak and Oct. 6 reported that they found evidence of \"detonations … which have caused extensive damage to the gas pipelines.\" Although European authorities believe the pipelines were sabotaged by \"state actors\" on behalf of a foreign country, they have identified no suspects. Russia and Western countries have traded blame for the leaks. Norway’s military presence Norwegian officials said the country deployed its soldiers to offshore oil and gas processing plants in the Baltic Sea out of an abundance of caution to increase security around the pipelines and to ease concerns among plant workers, Reuters reported. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said during a news conference that Britain, France and Germany will also help Norway patrol the area. The increased military presence is unrelated to Biden, and Norway has made no public statements implying the U.S. caused the leaks. Our ruling A Facebook post claims Norway sent soldiers to guard the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea to protect them from the U.S. government following the discovery of leaks. Norway did deploy its military to guard part of the pipeline network as a safety precaution. But it did not blame the U.S. for the leaks. Investigators have said they believe the leaks were the result of detonations and likely sabotage, but no suspects have been named. We rate this claim False",

         "\"$12 billion more for Ukraine on top of $100+ billion while Jackson, Mississippi has yet to receive any funding to fix their water infrastructure. After years of decline and neglect, the water infrastructure in Jackson, Mississippi, failed in August, leaving city residents scrambling for access to clean water. Fixing the problem could cost more than $1 billion. According to social media posts, none of the money has been forthcoming. \"$12 billion more for Ukraine on top of $100+ billion while Jackson, Mississippi has yet to receive any funding to fix their water infrastructure,\" said a Sept. 27 post on Instagram shared by actor D.L. Hughley. The post was a screenshot of a tweet. \"Make it make sense … \" Hughley wrote in the caption. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The post appears to refer to a bill that was under consideration at the time of the Instagram post and that passed Sept. 30. The legislation allotted $12 billion in new aid to Ukraine. But what the post does not acknowledge is that the same legislation also allocated $20 million to the city of Jackson for repairs to its water infrastructure. It’s a small portion of the overall funding required to completely fix the problems in Jackson. And while the city might not have the money in hand yet because the legislation just passed, it’s misleading to say the city was completely ignored. At the time of Hughley’s post, Congress was set to consider a funding package to address multiple needs, including money for Ukraine and Jackson. That bill, H.R. 6833, passed Sept. 30 and President Joe Biden signed it the same day. Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said in a press release that the $20 million allocated for Jackson would \"build on the initial $5 million provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers earlier this year through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\" \"I recognize this funding will not be enough to address the long-standing water infrastructure issues in Jackson, but this is a good start,\" Wicker said in his release. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said during an Aug. 30 press conference that it would take $1 billion to fix the water distribution system, and billions more to fix all of the water problems. We reached out to his office but received no response. The issue is also one of racial disparity — in Jackson, more than 80% of residents are Black. Jackson also stands to benefit from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but it is unclear how much the city might receive. Our ruling An Instagram post says Ukraine got $12 billion more in funding but Jackson, Mississippi, has not received any. At the time the Instagram post was shared, Congress was considering legislation to provide money to both Ukraine and Jackson. The legislation passed Sept. 30 and was signed into law the same day, allocating $20 million to Jackson for its infrastructure. Much more funding will be needed to fully address the city’s problems. But though the city might not have the money in hand yet because the funding was just approved, it’s misleading to say the city was completely ignored. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False",

         "2018 interview shows Bill Gates has changed his position on clean energ Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder and global public health philanthropist, explained in a 2018 interview why certain cheap, renewable energy sources will not fully solve the world’s climate crisis. A recent social media post suggests the 2018 interview shows Gates has changed his position on clean energy. \"Back in 2018 when Bill Gates would still admit the truth about ‘clean energy’ madness,\" read the caption of the two-minute video shared Sept. 26 on Facebook. The post’s caption highlighted one of Gates' comments from the video: \"Whenever we came up with this term ‘clean energy,’ I think it screwed up people’s minds!\" The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook.) Gates did say that, but the video cherry picked a moment from his commentary to suggest he was critical of efforts to support sustainable energy. The full interview makes it clear that Gates supported renewable energy. But he also said that electricity is only 25% of greenhouse gas emissions and that more must be done to deal with emissions from airplanes, cows, cement, steel and other sources. In addition, more reliable sources of clean energy must be developed for large population centers. The footage in the post was taken from a 36-minute interview Gates gave to Stanford University’s Arun Majumdar on Nov. 2, 2018, as part of the university’s two-day Global Energy Forum. \"A lot of people are very optimistic, as you know, with wind and solar — the renewable costs coming down, the battery costs are coming down,\" Majumdar, now dean of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, said to Gates. \"Do you think that’s enough? Or do you think we need more?\" \"That is so disappointing,\" Gates answered. Then, he went on to describe the difficulty in restoring power to communities when they are hit with widespread power losses. Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 10, 2022 in a post “Premature babies are at a much higher risk of injury from immunizations than full-term babies.” By Andy Nguyen • October 13, 2022 Using solar panels, wind turbines and batteries is not enough to curb greenhouse gasses, Gates said. \"Remember, electricity is 25% of greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \"Whenever we came up with this term ‘clean energy,’ I think it screwed up people’s minds, now they don’t understand.\" One of the challenges to confronting climate change is that people think that switching to batteries or solar panels is enough, he said. In the full clip, Gates says, \"The idea that we have the current tools and it’s just because these utility people are evil people, and if we would just beat on them and put (solar panels) on our rooftop, that’s more of a block than climate denial,\" he said. \"The ‘climate is easy to solve’ group is our biggest problem.\" In a blog post published just a few weeks before the Stanford interview, Gates wrote that it’s generally good news that cheaper renewable energy sources are spreading around the world. \"Renewables are getting cheaper and many countries are committing to rely more on them and less on fossil fuels for their electricity needs,\" he wrote. \"That’s good news, at least in places that get a lot of sunlight or wind. Everyone who cares about climate change should hope we continue to de-carbonize the way we generate electricity.\" Our ruling A Facebook post suggests that a 2018 interview shows Gates has changed his position on clean energy.

         "“I voted with Trump on trade. In the Ohio U.S. Senate race, Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan has drawn criticism for glossing over the details of his position on trade under former President Donald Trump. An ad from Ryan’s campaign shows him speaking to voters about his record representing Ohio in the House of Representatives since 2003. \"Patriotism means supporting the American worker,\" he says. \"Why I voted with Trump on trade. We have to have the guts to take on China, bring back manufacturing, and cut taxes for workers.\" The Republican opposition research group America Rising tweeted a rebuttal. \"Tim Ryan attacked President Trump's tariffs on China as ‘nonsensical,’\" the group said Sept. 28. In June, the National Republican Senatorial Campaign drew on Ryan’s response to a 2020 Washington Post candidate questionnaire, in which Ryan challenged Trump’s approach to tariffs. The Republican group homed in on Ryan saying the tariffs were \"abominable\" and had \"cost American farmers, manufacturers and working families billions of dollars.\" What that GOP summary left out were the first words in Ryan’s answer to the Washington Post. \"Tariffs on China are an absolute necessity for balancing the American trade deficit,\" Ryan said. \"With that being said, the goods being targeted — and the tariff rates — are abominable and must be revised immediately.\" To sort this out, we unpack Ryan’s voting record and his statements on trade and tariffs. Ryan’s votes In the Trump years, the primary, if not the sole, opportunity Ryan had to vote for or against Trump’s policy was congressional approval of the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade act, known as USMCA. The 2020 agreement was a rewrite of the 1993 North American Free Trade Act, NAFTA. Trump had railed against NAFTA when he ran for office, and the new agreement was a legislative milestone. Ryan joined 192 Democrats and 192 Republicans to approve the USMCA 385 to 41. That was the vote Ryan referred to in his ad, and it broke with Ryan’s typical position on trade. Ryan has a long history of voting against free trade agreements. In June 2015, he opposed granting President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major Obama priority. In 2011, he voted against trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. His string of anti-free-trade votes goes back to a 2003 vote against a pact with Chile. Ryan was on the losing side every time. Ryan’s take on Trump’s tariffs As a presidential candidate, Trump said he would use tariffs to limit the flow of Chinese products, especially steel and aluminum, to the United States. Before the details were clear, Ryan backed the move. Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 \"China has been eating our lunch for decades,\" Ryan tweeted March 1, 2018. \"These actions will protect good-paying jobs in Ohio and across the country.\" On March 8, 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum, except for imports from Canada and Mexico. At that point, Ryan began to push back. In a letter to Trump, he voiced support for the tariffs on China, but argued that the order should have exempted European producers. \"Implemented in a practical and measured approach, these tariffs will help protect our steel and aluminum industries from further decline,\" Ryan wrote March 22, 2018. \"But without these additional exemptions for our important allies, our steel industry will experience chaos and job loss.\" China retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on American soybeans and other farm goods. Trump devised a payment system to help farmers, but Ryan criticized the overall approach. \"I’m tired of our farmers getting the short end of the Trump stick. We don’t need more tariffs — we need an agricultural agenda that helps our farmers compete in the 21st century,\" Ryan tweeted May 15, 2019. Research says the tariff war hurt the U.S. There’s a growing body of evidence that the tariff strategy backfired. A December 2020 summary from the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ nonpartisan policy arm, said most studies \"suggest a negative overall effect on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of the tariffs.\" A group of economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University said manufacturing companies bore the brunt of the tariffs, and overall wages were slightly lower than they would have been. Economists at Yale and Pennsylvania State University found the tariffs caused a 0.1% decline in household spending, with some states doing better than others, but most states ending up worse off. They said, \"The trade war was ineffective in reversing the decline in manufacturing employment.\" Most studies, the Congressional Research Service said, found that U.S. consumers and companies \"bore nearly the entire increased costs associated with the tariffs.\" Our ruling Ryan said that he voted with Trump on trade. His vote supporting the USMCA speaks to that. Trump often spoke against free trade agreements. And before Trump took office, Ryan consistently voted against free trade bills. Outside of his voting record, Ryan backed Trump’s use of tariffs against China and Russia, but opposed them when Trump applied the tariffs to U.S. allies in Europe. He warned that without more-targeted tariffs, Americans would be worse off. Research later determined that American earnings and employment suffered under Trump’s trade war. The statement in Ryan’s ad is accurate, but it leaves out worthwhile context. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

         "Kamala Harris said about Hurricane Ian that “if you have a different skin color, you're going to get relief faster. After Hurricane Ian made landfall in both southwest Florida and South Carolina, an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris stirred up its own storm. Harris was speaking with actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas on Sept. 30 before the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. She paused to listen as Chopra Jonas spent a minute and 12 seconds asking a winding series of questions about Hurricane Ian relief efforts, the Biden administration’s climate efforts in the U.S. and the global implications of climate change. \"I’m gonna unpack that question,\" Harris responded with a laugh, before giving a more-than-five-minute answer that touched on a number of topics, including Hurricane Ian, the Biden administration’s climate policies and disparities among those harmed by climate change. But conservatives, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, seized on a shortened, out-of-context clip of Harris’ answer to make it seem as if Harris said federal storm relief would be based solely on race and equity. Scott, a Republican, claimed on CBS’ \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Harris said relief would be \"faster\" if you \"have a different skin color.\" Host Margaret Brennan said \"disasters are a time when people can come together\" and asked Scott about what she described as \"disturbing rhetoric\" from former President Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Brennan asked Scott whether he rebuked those comments, but he focused on Harris instead. \"I think what we got to do is we got to bring everybody together,\" Scott said. \"I'd also say that what Vice President Harris said yesterday or the day before yesterday, that, you know if you have a different skin color, you're going to get relief faster, that’s not helpful either.\" When Brennan said that wasn’t what Harris had said, Scott shot back, \"That's exactly what she meant.\" Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 12, 2022 in an Instagram post Pfizer executive “admits” vaccine was never tested for preventing transmission. By Jeff Cercone • October 13, 2022 We reached out to Scott’s office for evidence to back his claim but have not heard back. Harris’ comments made the rounds on social media and conservative news outlets such as Fox News and The Daily Caller before Scott’s TV appearance. Conservative activist Ryan Fournier said in a tweet that Harris \"said the administration will be giving hurricane resources ‘based on equity’ by directing funds to ‘communities of color.’\" Fournier’s post received more than a million video views and responses from high-profile people like Elon Musk and Christina Pushaw with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ re-election campaign. So what did Harris say? The full exchange between Chopra Jonas and Harris shows that neither the question nor the answer was solely about Hurricane Ian relief money, but touched on several topics. Watch the full exchange below. Chopra Jonas, in a lengthy preamble to her question, spoke about how extreme weather like Hurricane Ian is becoming more frequent and severe. She credited the Biden administration for passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $369 billion for initiatives such as manufacturing clean energy products, cutting emissions and environmental justice. She also said the U.S. sets an example for other nations to follow on climate policy. \"Can you talk just a little bit about the relief efforts, obviously, of Hurricane Ian and what the administration has been doing to address the climate crisis in the states?\" Chopra Jonas asked Harris. Before Harris could answer, Chopra Jonas added a follow-up question: \"We consider the global implications of emissions. The poorest countries are affected the most, they contribute the least and are affected the most. So how should voters in the U.S. feel about the administration’s long-term goals when it comes to being an international influencer on this topic?\" Harris responded first by touting the $369 billion in funding in the Inflation Reduction Act \"dedicated to addressing the climate crisis,\" which she said is a crisis \"evidenced by Ian, by the wildfires happening in California, the floods, the hurricanes.\" Harris said she thought about climate policy \"in terms of the human toll.\" \"I know we are all thinking about the families in Florida, in Puerto Rico with (Hurricane) Fiona, and what we need to do to help them in terms of an immediate response and aid, but also what we need to do to help restore communities, and build communities back up in a way that they can be resilient, not to mention adapt to these extreme weather conditions, which are part of the future.\" Harris then addressed Chopra Jones’ \"point about disparities.\" She described an environmental justice unit she started when she was San Francisco district attorney that focused on \"the disparities issue you have described, rightly.\" She said \"it is our lowest-income communities and communities of color that are most impacted by these extreme conditions, and impacted by issues that are not of their own making.\" \"So, we have to address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity, understanding that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity, understanding that not everybody starts out at the same place.\" Andrew Bates, White House deputy press secretary, called the claims Scott and others made \"inaccurate.\" \"The vice president was addressing a different subject: long-term climate resilience investments passed with strong bipartisan support,\" Bates said in a statement to PolitiFact. Bates said Harris had already responded to the first part of the question that specifically mentioned Hurricane Ian by \"emphasizing that we are urgently responding to all Americans hurt by the storm.\" \"She had explicitly moved on to answering the second question — on ‘long-term goals’ for how to ‘address the climate crisis in the states’ — by mentioning the long-term investments that Congress, with Republican support, specifically set aside for communities that are vulnerable because of a lack of infrastructure resources,\" the statement said. Nandita Bose, a Reuters White House correspondent covering the Harris event, tweeted a lengthy thread and wrote that the vice president’s words were \"being deliberately distorted.\" So I was the only WH pool print reporter in the room on Friday at the DNC Women's Leadership Forum and heard the remarks from @VP on climate change and Hurricane Ian, which I see are being deliberately distorted. Here is what she said.— Nandita Bose (@nanditab1) October 3, 2022 Federal Emergency Management Association Administrator Deanne Criswell also addressed Harris’ interview on CBS’ \"Face the Nation,\" after Scott’s appearance. While responding to VP Harris’s comments about equity and equality with disaster relief, FEMA head Deanne Criswell acknowledges there are people who have a “hard time” and encounter “barriers” accessing aid, but “our programs support everybody.” pic.twitter.com/pfCW9mn3x4— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 2, 2022 Criswell said Harris was not speaking about immediate relief efforts, and that FEMA’s aid will go to everyone who needs help. \"I believe some of the things the vice president was talking about are the long-term recovery and rebuilding these communities to be able to withstand disasters, so they can have less impact,\" Criswell said. \"We're going to support all communities. I committed that to the governor, I commit to you right here that all Floridians are going to be able to get the help that is available to them through our programs.\" There is nothing on a FEMA webpage for Hurricane Ian victims or the federal Disaster Assistance Improvement Program specific to race or equity, just information about how Floridians affected by the storm can get help. Elsewhere, FEMA’s website does address the agency's efforts to improve equity in services \"so all people, including those from vulnerable and underserved communities, can get help when they need it.\" Our ruling Scott claimed Harris said, \"if you have a different skin color, you're going to get relief faster\" after Hurricane Ian. Harris said no such thing in a response to a question that touched on several topics, including Hurricane Ian, climate change policy and disparities in who is most harmed by climate change and extreme weather. We rate this claim False. Clarification, Oct. 6, 2022: This story has been updated to clarify that the FEMA webpage for Hurricane Ian victims linked to in this story doesn’t mention race or equity. Elsewhere, the agency’s website does discuss its efforts regarding equity. The rating is unchange",

On Sept. 28, police in Stockton, California, revealed that they are investigating similarities between recent homicides in the city. \"We do not know if it is one suspect or multiple suspects,\" the Stockton Police Department said in a statement posted that day on Facebook. But the same day, a different statement circulating on social media and attributed to Stockton City Council Member Kimberly Warmsley declared the deaths the work of a serial killer. \"Serial killer in Stockton ****FROM COUNCILWOMAN KIMBERLY WORMSELY (NOW!!!!),\" reads a Sept. 28 Instagram post that misspelled Warmsley’s name. \"Be careful!

By Michael Majchrowicz • October 17, 2022 But Warmsley, a Democrat, said she didn’t write or authorize the statement that’s been attributed to her, the Stockton Record reported. Warmsley said it took statements she made on social media out of context, according to the newspaper. On Sept. 28, Warmsley posted on Facebook that \"there have been a series of unusual activities, circumstances and patterns of homicides that are deeply concerning and alarming.\" She said officers were \"investigating the relationships between the incidents, the victims, and the suspects\" and that \"currently, the evidence does not point to or prove whether there is one, or multiple suspects.\" Later, on Sept. 30, the Stockton Police Department posted on Facebook a statement from Police Chief Stanley McFadden about the investigation. McFadden said officers believed that five killings since July are related and that a \"person of interest\" has been identified. The deaths involved men who were killed while they were alone \"in the evening or early morning hours.\" But that doesn’t corroborate claims that Warmsley said there’s a serial killer in Stockton. She denies that she made that statement, and we found no evidence to contradict that. We rate the claim False.",

         "“There have now been 16 straight months of OVER 150,000 illegal border crossings. Immigration and border security, always a major issue in U.S. politics, is attracting special attention in a midterm election year — particularly among Republicans who blame President Joe Biden for unusually large numbers of migrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., shared a video clip on Twitter showing White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responding to a reporter’s Aug. 29 question about people who illegally cross the border. In the tweet, Mooney added his own comment: \"In June, there were 207,416 migrant encounters at our southern border. There have now been 16 straight months of OVER 150,000 illegal border crossings.\" In June, there were 207,416 migrant encounters at our southern border. There have now been 16 straight months of OVER 150,000 illegal border crossings. https://t.co/Le3uHDJ0v3— Rep. Alex Mooney (@RepAlexMooney) August 29, 2022 Mooney’s statement is accurate, and the trend has continued beyond the 16 months he cited, according to official federal data. Mooney’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article. But some additional context is needed. We turned to the past four years of statistics from Customs and Border Protection, covering encounters between migrants and law enforcement officers on the southwest land border. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\"); After a decline in border encounters at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the number rose in early 2021 and passed 150,000 in March 2021. Between then and August 2022, the number has never fallen below 150,000 per month. That’s 18 consecutive months. Featured Fact-check Blake Masters stated on October 15, 2022 in a tweet Immigrants illegally in the country are treated “better than military veterans.” By Jon Greenberg • October 21, 2022 Alex Nowrasteh, director of economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, confirmed to PolitiFact that CBP’s numbers are the most accurate measurement of the scale of illegal border crossings. However, the number of encounters is not the same as the number of individuals crossing the border, because the same person might cross the border and be encountered by law enforcement more than once. This many monthly border encounters is unusually high, PolitiFact Wisconsin concluded in July. It rated Mostly True the statement that \"with three months remaining in the fiscal year, (the border patrol) has already encountered more illegal immigrants along the Southwest border\" than in any previous fiscal year. Under a public health policy in place to mitigate COVID-19’s spread, some immigrants are immediately sent back to the country they came from after encounters with Border Patrol. So, even though these immigrants were included in the encounters data, they were not admitted into the United States. It’s also worth noting that many people who cross the border are seeking asylum. Under immigration law, people must be physically in the United States to request asylum, and may request it even if they entered illegally. Our ruling Mooney said, \"There have now been 16 straight months of OVER 150,000 illegal border crossings.\" CBP data shows that immigrant encounters with the Border Patrol have exceeded 150,000 per month for more than 16 months. However, the data does not show that more than 150,000 people crossed the border illegally each month. The encounters data tracks events, not people. Also, not all people who crossed the border were admitted into the country; some were expelled under a public health order to stop COVID-19 from spreading. Mooney’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly Tru",

         "Hurricane Ian was orchestrated as part of a pandemic-related conspiracy to devastate Floridians Floridians have started the process of recovery after Hurricane Ian wrecked large swaths of the state. But some social media users are starting a different process — taking up a conspiracy theory that the Category 4 hurricane was staged. An Instagram user claimed in a Sept. 29 post that people had been \"tricked\" into moving to Florida during the pandemic because of its anti-COVID-19 mandate ideology, and then fallen victim to a storm that had been government-engineered. It was \"all just a set up,\" the post said. \"The ‘storm of the century’ as it is being called is unfortunately another one of many examples of how the government engineers weather to completely destroy places and as always they will use predictive programming to show you they're going to do it in advance,\" the user wrote. We saw the narrative being shared elsewhere, too. \"They created that hurricane that hit Florida!!\" one Facebook post said. Former GOP candidates DeAnna Lorraine and Lauren Witzke suggested in a video that the storm was engineered specifically to target more conservative areas of Florida. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 Like all hurricanes, Hurricane Ian was created by natural environmental causes. Hurricanes take form over open air and warm ocean water. \"When humid air is flowing upward at a zone of low pressure over warm ocean water, the water is released from the air,\" the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research explains on its website. \"As it rises, the air in a hurricane rotates.\" It first forms as a \"tropical disturbance,\" then a tropical depression, into a tropical storm and then, if it continues to grow past wind speeds of 74 miles per hour, a hurricane. The longer the storm stays over warm water, the bigger it grows. Hurricanes usually peak between June 30 and Nov. 1, known as hurricane season. It’s not just the winds of a hurricane that cause damage when the storm makes landfall — National Geographic explains that they also cause dangerous storm surge. \"Storm surge is caused when winds from an approaching hurricane push water towards the shoreline up to 20 feet above sea level and can extend 100 miles,\" National Geographic said in a video. \"Ninety percent of all hurricane deaths are the result of storm surge.\" The notion that this hurricane — or any hurricane — was engineered by humans as some sort of political punishment appears to be spreading among adherents of QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that promotes the idea that the world is run by a cabal of pedophiles that include high-profile Democrats and celebrities and that former President Donald Trump is working with military leaders to quash it.

But just in time for spooky season, a popular Instagram post is reviving the long-debunked claim that they did. \"When you ask a historian why there are giant human caucasian skeletons in Ohio that predate any known civilizations,\" read words that hover over a video showing a person mumbling, \"I don’t even know. Like, I couldn’t even tell you that.\" The Sept 26 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) (Screenshot from Instagram.) Unproven myths that giant human beings once lived in Ohio have circulated for nearly 200 years. Stories of discoveries of giant skeletons date back to at least 1845, The Columbus Dispatch reported. These baseless claims that giant skeletons were discovered aren’t limited to Ohio, either. They’ve been said to have been found in India, Saudi Arabia and New York. In each case, fact-checkers have debunked the supposed discoveries. Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 12, 2022 in a Facebook post “Trump woken up from his bed by police.” By Ciara O'Rourke • October 14, 2022 Some of the claims were traced back to doctored images spread by social media users. One such image that features researchers unearthing what appears to be a massive human skeleton was a Photoshop contest entry, Reuters reported. Another image held up as evidence of giants also resulted from Photoshop magic. The artist, a Canada-based illustrator who uses the name IronKite online, told National Geographic that he digitally superimposed a human skeleton over the remains of a mastodon that was excavated in Hyde Park, New York, in 2004. Ohio-focused claims about giants appear to have a very particular origin, though. In the late 1800s, a man named John Everhart excavated Brush Creek Mound, a landmark in Muskingum County, Ohio. Everhart claimed he’d recovered a sandstone slab inscribed with hieroglyphics and several skeletons each more than 8 feet tall, according to a Columbus Dispatch report. His account later crumbled: A worker who once worked for Everhart testified in court that he’d been promised $15 to carve the \"ancient\" hieroglyphics into the slab. Similarly, a member of Everhart’s excavation crew acknowledged that \"all the skeletons were so much crumbled that it was difficult to make accurate measurements,\" The Dispatch said. Our ruling An Instagram post said \"there are giant human caucasian skeletons in Ohio that predate any known civilizations.\" This claim traces back to decades-old myths and rumors — some of which stem from photo-editing contests. PolitiFact found no corroborated evidence suggesting that ancient, giant human skeletons were found in Ohio. We rate these claims False. Correction, Oct. 3, 2022: This fact-check has been corrected to reflect that Brush Creek Mound in Muskingum County, Ohio, is a separate, distinct landmark from Serpent Mound in Adams County, Ohio.

         "Raphael Warnock \"called police thugs, then cut their funding. In Georgia’s high-profile Senate race, Republican Herschel Walker is airing an ad in which he looks directly into the camera and criticizes his opponent, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. The ad opens with a series of short clips of news anchors narrating crime stories, followed by a narrator telling viewers, \"The Democrats’ answer to rising crime? Defund the police. Put criminals ahead of victims.\" Then, Walker appears, telling viewers, \"Raphael Warnock called police thugs, then cut their funding. Now he wants to end cash bail, putting criminals back out on the street. I'm Herschel Walker. I approved this message because stopping crime starts by keeping bad guys in jail.\" We found that Walker’s assertion that Warnock \"called police thugs, then cut their funding\" is misleading. Walker’s campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article. (Screenshot) Warnock’s use of the word ‘thugs’ in a sermon This appears to refer to remarks Warnock made in a sermon on March 8, 2015, when he was pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. He gave the sermon about seven months after police shot and killed an unarmed Black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, an event that led to widespread local protests, some of which turned violent. Warnock’s sermon came days after the Justice Department declined to prosecute the officer who shot Brown. The department issued a report highly critical of how officials ran the local police and government, including an elaborate system of fines and penalties that disproportionately affected low-income Black residents. The sermon also came one day after the 50th anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday,\" in which law enforcement officers beat marchers who were peacefully advocating for voting rights while crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The confrontation is considered one of the key turning points of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Warnock’s sermon expounded on the differences between God’s power and man’s, periodically circling back to both Selma and Ferguson. He urged congregants to read the Justice Department report on Ferguson, saying it showed how ordinary Ferguson residents were forced to carry the weight of the criminal justice system by having to pay fines and penalties they had no realistic chance of paying. This enforcement of spiraling penalties on poor and mostly Black residents prompted Warnock’s \"thug\" comments, as he equated the baton beatings on the Pettus bridge with the lower-profile but grinding injustices of Ferguson. \"And as they gathered in Selma — or was it Ferguson?\" Warnock said at one point. \"They were met with overwhelming brute force. The truth of the matter is, the road to Ferguson goes through Selma, 50 years later.\" Featured Fact-check Tim Michels stated on October 24, 2022 in News conference Tony Evers “wants to let out between 9,000 and 10,000 more” Wisconsin prisoners By Madeline Heim • November 4, 2022 Warnock went on to say, \"So, in Ferguson, police power (is) showing up in a kind of gangster and thug mentality. You can wear all kinds of colors and be a thug. You can sometimes wear the colors of the state and behave like a thug.\" The bottom line is that Warnock used the word \"thug\" to describe certain specific police behaviors, evoking police violence in Selma and referencing police practices in Ferguson. Warnock did not cut police funding We found no evidence that Warnock has sought to cut police funding. The way Walker phrased his ad is also misleading. It gives the impression that Warnock cut police funding right after calling police \"thugs.\" However, Warnock’s sermon was in 2015; he assumed his first elected office in the Senate in January 2021. Warnock’s campaign argued that the senator had done the opposite of what Walker claimed. His staff pointed to his co-sponsorship of the Invest to Protect Act, a measure passed unanimously by the Senate that seeks to help small law enforcement agencies with training, equipment, mental health support, officer recruitment and retention. A companion bill in the House also passed, but the two measures have not yet been reconciled. More broadly, the Biden administration has emphasized that it supports full funding for law enforcement. The American Rescue Plan, which he signed into law in March 2021, provided $350 billion that cities, states and counties can use to hire police and invest in community violence interruption. (Critics have falsely claimed that President Joe Biden supports defunding the police.) A September 2022 analysis by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit that seeks a more \"humane justice system,\" found that billions of dollars flowed from the American Rescue Plan to the criminal justice system through the first quarter of 2022, \"from covering payroll to purchasing new equipment.\" The group found that government entities have so far allocated $101 billion of the total $350 billion, and about a quarter of that has gone to police, courts, and corrections. Warnock, like every Senate Democrat, voted in favor of the American Rescue Plan. Our ruling Walker said that Warnock \"called police thugs, then cut their funding.\" Warnock, in a sermon, said police in Ferguson were manifesting their power in thuggish behavior. He was referring to a Justice Department report that said Ferguson police disproportionately targeted Black people with fines and penalties. Warnock in his sermon also referred to police violence in Selma in 1965. Warnock did not apply the word \"thugs\" to all police officers. Meanwhile, Warnock has not \"cut\" police funding. He sponsored a bill to help small police departments hire and keep officers. He also voted for the American Rescue Plan, which provided billions of dollars to states and local jurisdictions to invest in police departments and other efforts to secure communities.

         "Mark Finchem “wants to strip Arizona’s citizens of their capacity to vote by mail. Election rules have become the central issue in the race for Arizona secretary of state. In a recent debate, Democrat Adrian Fontes said Republican Mark Finchem wants to make it harder for many Arizonans to cast their ballots. \"Mr. Finchem wants to strip Arizona’s citizens of their capacity to vote by mail,\" Fontes said in the Sept. 22 debate on Arizona PBS. Finchem rejected the charge. \"I support absentee ballot voting,\" Finchem said. \"I do not support the idea of sending ballots to people who have not requested it.\" We examined Finchem’s legislative record and found that changes he has backed would have altered the voting options for millions of Arizonans. Early and mail-in voting widely used in Arizona More than 20 years ago, the state was an early adopter in allowing people to vote by mail without providing specific excuses, such as being out of state. In 2007, the state built on that policy by giving voters the option to put their names on a permanent early voter list. The state would automatically send these voters a ballot each election. They could either return their ballot by mail or put it in an early voting ballot box in a designated voting center. In 2021, the state tightened the rules and created what it now called the Active Early Voter List. Voters who failed to vote at least once in two consecutive two-year election cycles would fall off that list. According to the nonpartisan Clean Elections Commission, in the 2020 election, 89% of ballots in Arizona were cast by mail or drop box. That represented more than 3 million votes. A state-by-state analysis of methods of voting in 2016 by the Pew Research Center found that Arizona led the country with the most ballots cast by mail in states that offered \"no-excuse\" absentee voting. \"Mr. Finchem has been a vocal opponent of no-excuse mail-in voting and sponsored a bill this year to get rid of it – among other election changes,\" said Paul Bentz, senior vice president at HighGround, a political consulting group with ties to the Republican Party. Finchem was one of 13 Arizona House Republicans who introduced HB 2596 early in 2022. Although the bill did not pass, one clause would have repealed the Active Early Voter List. Arizonans without a specific reason for voting by mail would no longer have had that option. Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on October 25, 2022 in an Instagram post The documentary “2,000 Mules proves” Democrats “cheated on the 2020 elections.” By Jon Greenberg • October 28, 2022 Paul Bender, a law professor at Arizona State University School of Law, said the bill also would have strictly restricted absentee voting. \"Finchem would permit mail-in voting only if the voter is out of state or otherwise unable to go to the polls to vote,\" Bender said. The exceptions included people with visual challenges, and those with physical impairments that have put them in the hospital or in a nursing home, and those serving out of state in the military. In the debate, Finchem said \"I don’t care for mail-in voting. I prefer absentee voting.\" He is a member of the America First Secretary of State Coalition, a group that lists eliminating mail-in ballots as one of its goals. During a July campaign speech, Finchem said, \"I don’t believe in mail-in ballots at all. That’s where the fraud happens.\" We reached out to Finchem and did not hear back. Our ruling Fontes said that Finchem \"wants to strip Arizona’s citizens of their capacity to vote by mail.\" Arizona allows people to vote early by mail without citing a specific reason for doing so. In the 2020 election, 89% of ballots were cast by mail or drop box. Finchem co-sponsored a bill to limit who could vote by mail and to revoke the active early voter list. People on that list automatically receive a mail ballot if they’ve voted at least once in two consecutive two-year election cycles. While Finchem supports voting by mail for select groups of people, his efforts aim to eliminate that option for many Arizonans. We rate this claim Mostly True.

A social media user combined anxiety about crossings at the U.S. southern border and the future hiring of new IRS agents to create a post that’s misleading and incorrect. \"America now has a government that forbids Border agents from using deadly force … but is training IRS agents to use SWAT Team tactics on law abiding citizens,\" the Instagram post, shared Aug. 21, read. The post is among many misleading claims about the IRS that have surfaced since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law Aug. 16, providing the agency with $80 billion in funding over 10 years. Many falsely claimed the IRS is hiring 87,000 new, armed IRS agents who will target middle-class taxpayers. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The post is wrong about Border Patrol agents’ ability to use deadly force, and it misleads about the role of IRS agents and how they interact with taxpayers. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection use-of-force policy dated January 2021 specifies that deadly force may be used by Border Patrol agents if those agents recognize a sufficient threat. The agency \"is entrusted with the critical responsibility of protecting our nation’s borders,\" it reads. \"This mandate carries with it the authority to use force up to and including the use of deadly force.\" Such force is considered \"necessary\" when there is a \"reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury\" to the agent or another person, the policy says. Yolanda Choates, a CBP spokesperson, confirmed to PolitiFact that agents may use lethal force to enforce the law. A Border Patrol Tactical Unit fatally shot the gunman in the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting on May 24, in which 19 students and two teachers were killed. In addition, CBP press statements show there have been at least three other fatal use-of-force incidents involving Border Patrol agents in 2022. Featured Fact-check Blake Masters stated on October 15, 2022 in a tweet Immigrants illegally in the country are treated “better than military veterans.” By Jon Greenberg • October 21, 2022 Within the IRS, the agents whom typical taxpayers would encounter in a routine audit do not carry weapons. The agency does, however, have a Criminal Investigation division. There were 2,046 agents in that division in 2021, a small fraction of the IRS’ roughly 80,000-member workforce. Those agents carry weapons and investigate crimes such as money laundering, fraud and narcotics-related financial cases. They are permitted to use deadly force if needed, according to a job description and an IRS webpage. The agents undergo extensive firearms training, which includes drills using tactical gear and breaching equipment, according to an IRS description of the agents’ training program. But IRS policy is to assess risk before any raid involving the special agents. If entry is determined to be \"high-risk,\" the agents will not enter, according to the IRS. In those cases, \"specially trained entry teams from other local, state, or federal agencies will be considered,\" and special agents may conduct their search after the scene has been secured, the agency said. Our ruling An Instagram post claimed \"America now has a government that forbids Border agents from using deadly force … but is training IRS agents to use SWAT Team tactics on law abiding citizens.\" Border Patrol agents are permitted to use deadly force if they believe they or another person are at risk of death or injury. A small group of IRS agents — special agents in the Criminal Investigation division — can also use deadly force. But such force is not randomly employed on typical taxpayers, as the post claimed. Americans facing routine audits do not encounter these agents. IRS special agents train with tactical gear and breaching equipment. However, IRS policy is to assess risk before entering a home or business in a criminal investigation, and if the situation is deemed high-risk, a specially trained team will secure the location instead.

         "Sen. Raphael Warnock \"voted with Biden to slash Medicare spending. It’s a staple of campaign season: Either Republicans or Democrats claim that the opposite party intends to slash Medicare, the federal health insurance program for Americans age 65 and older. This theme has come up in Georgia’s Senate race, which pits Republican Herschel Walker against incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. On Sept. 16, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released an ad that targeted Warnock for supporting President Joe Biden’s agenda. \"It didn't take long for Raphael Warnock to become a politician,\" the ad’s narrator says. \"Now he claims he's bipartisan? Not exactly. Warnock voted with Biden to slash Medicare spending. He voted with Biden to cripple U.S. oil production. And Warnock voted with Biden for huge spending that is fueling inflation. Look closely, and you'll see: Raphael Warnock votes with Joe Biden 96% of the time.\" (Screenshot) For starters, it’s a stretch to say \"it didn’t take long\" for Warnock to become a politician, since he spent most of his adult life as a preacher before winning his first bid for elected office at age 51. As for two of the ad’s other assertions, we’ve previously concluded that Walker oversold the extent of anti-oil drilling policies undertaken by Biden, and found that Biden’s American Rescue Plan probably did exacerbate inflation, although multiple other factors were involved, too. In this article, we’ll examine whether \"Warnock voted with Biden to slash Medicare spending.\" The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not respond to inquiries for this article. However, we recently looked at a similar statement and found the statement in this ad to be no more accurate. (Other outlets, including The Washington Post Fact Checker, CNN, and FactCheck.org have come to similar conclusions.) Featured Fact-check Rick Scott stated on October 30, 2022 in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" “All Democrats in the Senate and House voted to cut $280 billion out of Medicare just two months ago.” By Louis Jacobson • October 31, 2022 In the on-screen fine print, the ad cites Senate roll-call vote 325, which was the final vote to approve the Inflation Reduction Act, a Biden-backed bill that included provisions addressing climate change, the taxation of very large corporations, and Medicare drug pricing, among other topics. It passed both chambers with only Democratic votes, including Warnock’s, and it received Biden’s signature. The $300 billion — technically, somewhere between $237 billion and $288 billion, depending on how the numbers are estimated — stems from a provision in the Democratic bill that would end the longstanding bar that kept Medicare from negotiating with drugmakers over the price of certain medicines. Not being able to negotiate prices has meant that Medicare — the pharmaceutical market’s biggest single buyer — could not leverage its weight to secure lower prices for taxpayers. This has been part of the reason pharmaceutical prices in the U.S. have been higher than any other major country. Although the bill is projected to reduce federal spending by almost $300 billion, that would reflect government savings and not benefit cuts. In other words, Medicare recipients would receive the same amount of medicines, just for less taxpayer money. \"In reality, the bill's prescription drug savings would save the federal government nearly $300 billion through 2031 without cutting benefits,\" wrote the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors deficit reduction and has been skeptical of many of Biden’s legislative efforts, citing their cost. \"Lowering Medicare costs is not the same as reducing benefits,\" the committee wrote. \"Quite the opposite — many measures to reduce costs for the government would reduce costs for individuals as well.\" After combining the drug-cost savings with the bill’s other health care provisions, Medicare beneficiaries would see decreases in premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including through a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs, the committee projected. \"In addition to saving the government nearly $300 billion, the (bill) would save American families nearly $300 billion more,\" the committee has projected. Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, another group seeking to keep deficits low, told PolitiFact in August that the claims of Medicare cuts from this provision are problematic. \"Those are savings resulting mostly from the government negotiating prescription drug prices and limiting drug price increases to inflation,\" Ellis said. \"So rather than taking money out of Medicare, it is reducing Medicare costs.\" Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that Warnock \"voted with Biden to slash Medicare spending.\" This claim is more than misleading. The federal government would see its outlays reduced by about $300 billion as a result of a Medicare drug-price negotiation provision. However, that reduction wouldn’t represent cuts to Medicare beneficiaries. Rather, by leveraging Medicare’s market power, the government would be able to pay less to provide the same medicines, thus delivering the same level of benefits to people on Medicare.

         "“All weather is artificially controlled. Millions of people were tracking Hurricane Ian as it made its way across Florida. But one Instagram user told his followers not to watch the news about the storm, which he claimed had been \"controlled.\" \"Supposedly, we have this big hurricane coming to Florida, right?\" he said in a Sept. 27 video. \"I want to let you know that all weather is artificially controlled. Chemtrails, cloud seeding, tornadoes, hurricanes.\" He said that hurricanes could be created anywhere, and referenced an Alaska research program that uses radio transmitters to study the atmosphere. The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, also called HAARP, is the target of a baseless QAnon conspiracy theory that claims that it’s actually an instrument of the government, used to create weather and chemtrails. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We’ve fact-checked false claims about artificially created weather before. And chemtrails — a term conspiracy theorists use to describe the condensation trails behind aircrafts — aren’t real either. There is no evidence that Hurricane Ian was artificially concocted. The storm barrelled through Cuba and made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on Sept. 28.

If we didn’t believe in Hurricane Ian, it would still pummel the west coast of Florida.\" Humans can affect the weather, but they can’t direct it, Dessler said. \"By adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and causing the climate to warm, we are in fact turbocharging weather events to the detriment of humanity.

         "\"I was named Iowa’s most bipartisan member of Congress by @TheLugarCenter. Facing a re-election battle, Democratic U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, tweeted on Sept. 18 that she is one of the most bipartisan members of Congress and Iowa’s most bipartisan member. \"I don’t care what letter is next to your name — I’ll work with anyone to get results for Iowans. That’s why I was named Iowa’s most bipartisan member of Congress by @TheLugarCenter.\" She’s stated this before on Twitter, on July 11, for example. Plus, her congressional office issued a news release June 7 that said: \"I’m pleased to share that for the second year in a row I’ve been named the most bipartisan member of the Iowa congressional delegation by the Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.\" Axne is running for re-election for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District against Republican Sen. Zach Nunn. We looked at the Bipartisan Index Rankings, a partnership of the Lugar Center and Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, which ranked Axne as 20th among 435 voting U.S. House members in the most recent 2021 data released May 2. Comparisons show that Axne’s Index score of 1.11054 is slightly higher than that of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who scored at 1.07545. The higher the number, the better the score on bipartisanship. Dan Diller, policy director at The Lugar Center, wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan that the Senate and House data sets aren’t perfectly comparable. But, Diller said, it is fair to state that Axne is more bipartisan than Grassley, based on her record. \"A more valid point of comparison that clearly backs Axne’s claim is that she ranks 20th out of 435 House members, so she is in the 95th percentile of the House. Grassley ranks 12th out of 98 Senators, so he is roughly in the 88th percentile of the Senate,\" Diller wrote. \"Axne’s 20th ranking in the House is the highest by far among the Iowa House delegation. The closest to Axne is Rep. Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who ranks 86th. Diller wrote that Miller-Meeks’ score suggests she is outperforming the House historical average. We previously ruled Sen. Joni Ernst as Mostly True when she stated she is one of the most bipartisan senators in the Senate in the last 25 years in 2020. The Index had ranked her 34th out of 98 senators in 2019. Most recent data shows Ernst ranked 40th on the same bipartisanship Index –– with a 0.02598 score that is lower than Axne’s. Featured Fact-check Deidre DeJear stated on October 19, 2022 in a tweet \"Kim Reynolds doesn’t think nurses are educated.\" By Liam Halawith • October 31, 2022 Other measures exist. The FiveThirtyEight’s tally of House and the Senate votes with or against the president shows that Axne votes in line with Democratic President Joe Biden’s position 100 percent of the time. A different bipartisanship ideology score through GovTrack reported Axne in the 80th percentile for bipartisan bill co-sponsorship during the 116th Congress from 2019-21. Seventeen of Axne’s 36 bills and resolutions introduced during the session had a cosponsor from a different party. GovTrack’s methodology presents objective quantitative statistics for users to understand Axne’s legislation and make their own judgments. Diller wrote that The Index measures the frequency of each member of Congress co-sponsoring substantive bills introduced by an opposing party and the frequency with which they secure co-sponsors for their own bills from among the other party. \"For example, Joe Manchin is judged by 538 to have voted with President Biden 89 percent of the time, which sounds like a very high score,\" he wrote. \"But it is actually the lowest score among Democratic Senators. \"This is the second year in a row Rep. Axne has been recognized as the most bipartisan member of the Iowa delegation,\" Paige Godden, Axne campaign communications director, wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan. \"In 2021, Rep. Axne was also recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for her bipartisanship.\" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Axne a Spirit of Enterprise award for bipartisan work in 2020 and ranked her as the No. 2 most bipartisan in Iowa’s delegation with a 91 percent bipartisanship score. The chamber awarded the designation to 210 other U.S. House members and 49 U.S. Senate members. Axne did not make the chamber’s 2021 list of Jefferson-Hamilton Award winners for bipartisanship. Our ruling Axne tweeted in September that she is Iowa’s most bipartisan member of Congress. She ranks 20th among 435 voting U.S. House but has the highest bipartisanship record among the Iowa House and Senate delegation. However, FiveThirtyEight’s legislator vote tracker slates Axne taking action in line with Biden, a Democratic president, 100 percent of the time. And, comparing House and Senate bipartisanship scores is an inexact science. Despite her strong action toward Biden’s policies, we rate Axne’s statement as Mostly True because of her high bipartisanship rating based on objective data.",

         "Martha's Vineyard declared itself as a sanctuary city until the buses arrived Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ move to fly migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, generated plenty of criticism. But GOP leaders pushed back with a repeated claim — that the island had already declared itself a sanctuary destination. Peggy Hubbard, a former Illinois candidate for U.S. Senate, expressed the claim on Facebook. \"Martha's Vineyard declared itself as a sanctuary city until the buses arrived,\" she wrote in a Sep. 19 post along with two laughter emojis. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, there’s some basis for the claim that the island has embraced sanctuary policies, but the description could benefit from more context. That’s partly because Martha’s Vineyard isn’t a city; it’s made up of six small towns. We didn’t find evidence that Martha’s Vineyard as a whole has officially embraced sanctuary status. But, in 2017, three towns on the island did — including Edgartown, where the Venezuelan migrants were temporarily housed at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church. Before getting too far into the weeds, it helps to understand what \"sanctuary\" status really means. Experts told us it’s less a legal term than a political one. The American Immigration Council defines sanctuary policies as those for which \"state and local officials will limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials, but do not actively prevent federal officials from carrying out their immigration enforcement duties.\" And the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has defined a sanctuary jurisdiction as a \"community with a policy, written or unwritten, that discourages local law enforcement from reporting the immigration status of individuals unless it involves investigation of a serious crime.\" That aligns with action leaders in Edgartown, Chilmark and Tisbury appear to have taken. Minutes from Edgartown’s 2017 annual town meeting show its board of selectmen unanimously approved an article \"to authorize law enforcement and all town officials to refrain from using town funds and/or resources to enforce federal immigration laws, in keeping with current practice, unless presented with a criminal warrant or other evidence of probable cause, as required by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\" Also that year, boards for the towns of Tisbury and Chilmark unanimously approved measures that used identical or nearly identical wording. Featured Fact-check Facebook posts stated on October 14, 2022 in an Instagram post Video footage showing Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hiding on Jan. 6, 2021, shows the U.S. Capitol attack “was a setup.” By Madison Czopek • October 17, 2022 We reached out to officials in the three remaining communities — Oak Bluffs, West Tisbury and Aquinnah. Town administrators in West Tisbury and Aquinnah told PolitiFact that the town has not adopted sanctuary policies. We didn’t hear back from anyone in Oak Bluffs. And though we searched its meeting minutes, we did not find evidence that Oak Bluffs leaders have approved any measures adopting sanctuary policies. Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, explained that a legal definition for \"sanctuary\" doesn’t exist. \"It's a catch-all phrase, in popular terminology, to include a bunch of states and cities depending on various levels of their attitudes toward immigrants,\" Chishti said previously. We reached out to Hubbard for evidence behind her claim but didn’t get a response. Martha’s Vineyard residents worked with local and state officials to provide temporary shelter and necessities after the migrants arrived Sept. 14. Two days later, the Venezuelans were offered housing at a military base on nearby Cape Cod. At the time, Gov. Charlie Baker said \"the island communities are not equipped to provide sustainable accommodation, and state officials developed a plan to deliver a comprehensive humanitarian response.\" Massachusetts itself is not a sanctuary jurisdiction, although Democrats have tried to pass a bill to change that. In 2017, Massachusetts legislators proposed a bill called the Safe Communities Act, which sought to limit federal immigration enforcement practices throughout the commonwealth. Massachusetts Sen. Julian Cyr and state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, both Democrats who represent the area that includes Martha’s Vineyard, voted in favor of the bill, though the effort ultimately stalled. Since then, Democratic legislators reintroduced the bill, including during this year’s legislative session. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration, lists eight other Massachusetts cities as sanctuaries for immigrants: Amherst, Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Concord, Newton, Northampton and Somerville. The towns on Martha’s Vineyard are not named, though it’s not clear why. Our ruling Hubbard wrote that \"\"Martha's Vineyard declared itself as a sanctuary city until the buses arrived.\" Martha’s Vineyard is not a city; it’s an island made up of six small towns. At least three of those towns — Edgartown, Chilsmark and Tisbury — in 2017 adopted sanctuary policies. The migrants stayed temporarily in Edgartown after they arrived on Martha’s Vineyard. Two days later, they were offered accomodations at a military base on Cape Cod. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
